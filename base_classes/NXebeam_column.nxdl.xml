<!--
rationale for having NXebeam_column concepts in an own base class and not in NXinstrument_em
is that one may like to use the ebeam generating part also in other experiments-->

    <field name="operation_mode" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
             Typically tech-partner, microscope-, and control software-specific
             name of the specific operation mode how the ebeam_column and its
             components are controlled to achieve a specific illumination condition
             (typically referring to conditions illuminating the specimen).
             
             In many cases the users of an instrument do not know or can not be
             expected to know all the detailed spatiotemporal dynamics of their hardware.
             Instead, they rely of on assumptions that the instrument and its control software
             and parts work as expected to focus on their research questions.
             
             For this scenario it is useful to have the possibility to document the operation_mode
             in that it reports at least some constraints on how the illumination conditions were.
