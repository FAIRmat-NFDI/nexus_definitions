    <field name="operation_mode" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
             Typically tech-partner, microscope-, and control software-specific
             name of the specific operation mode how the ebeam_column and its
             components are controlled to achieve a specific illumination condition
             on the specimen.
             
             In many cases the users of an instrument do not know or are responsible
             for knowing all the detailed spatiotemporal dynamics of their hardware.
             Instead, they rely on the assumption that the instrument and its control software
             works as expected and thus can be used for research.
             
             Selecting then a specific operation_mode assures some level
             of reproducibility in the illumination conditions even though that
             the exact details of how the electron beam is deflected and shaped
             does not matter.
