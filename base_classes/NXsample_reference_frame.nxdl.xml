        Details about the sample reference frame that is typically overlaid
        onto the surface of the sample.
             
        It is assumed that the configuration is inspected by looking towards
        the sample surface. If a detector is involved, it is assumed that the 
        configuration is inspected from a position that is located behind this
        detector.
        
        If any of these assumptions is not met, the user is required to
        explicitly state this.
        
        Reference DOI: 10.1016/j.matchar.2016.04.008 suggest to label the base
        vectors of this coordinate system as Xs, Ys, Zs.
