			An identifier for a (persistent) resource.

			An identifier, provided by some authority, that has been assigned to the
			real-world object described by this ``NXobject``. To be useful, the identifier
			must not be reassigned to a different real-world object. It is typical for
			there to be some mechanism to resolve an identifier, obtaining metadata
			about the object. Identifiers for which some guarantees exist regarding
			this resolution process are called persistent identifiers.
			Persistent identifiers are also known as PIDs.
