<definition xmlns="http://definition.nexusformat.org/nxdl/3.1" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" category="base" type="group" name="NXinstrument_em" extends="NXinstrument" xsi:schemaLocation="http://definition.nexusformat.org/nxdl/3.1 ../nxdl.xsd">
    <doc>
         Base class for instrument-related details of a real or simulated electron microscope.
         
         For collecting data and experiments which are simulations of an electron
         microscope (or such session) use the :ref:`NXem` application definition and
         the :ref:`NXevent_data_em` groups it provides.
         
         This base class supports the concept of :ref:`NXem` to use one concept hierarchy
         for storing (meta)data that do change or not over the course of a session with the
         microscope.
         
         This design allows to store e.g. hardware related concepts only ones instead of
         demanding that each image or spectrum that is collected during a session is
         decorated with these static metadata.

             Description of the type of the detector.
             
             Electron microscopes have typically multiple detectors.
             Different technologies are in use like CCD, scintillator,
             direct electron, CMOS, or image plate to name but a few.
