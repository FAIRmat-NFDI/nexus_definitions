  Contains datastructures of an experimental optical setup (i.e Multiple
  Transfermatrix Tables).
  These datastructure, are used to relate physical properties of two beams
  (NXopt_beam) which have one common optical element (NXopt_element) (one 
  specific transfermatrix).
  One of these beams in an input beam and the other one is an output beam.

  The data describes the change of beam properties, i.e. The intensity of a
  beam is reduced, because the transmission coefficient of the opt element is 
  lower than 1.

      Select which type of data was recorded, for example Psi and Delta
      (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsometry#Data_acquisition).
      It is possible to have multiple selections. Data types may also be
      converted to each other, e.g. a Mueller matrix contains N,C,S data
      as well. This selection defines how many columns (N_variables) are
      stored in the data array.
      N in the name, is the index number in which order the given
      property is listed. 
    enumeration:
      [
        aperture,
        focal length,
        orientation,
        jones matrix,
      ]
  column_names:
    doc: |
      Please list in this array the column names used in your actual data.
      That is in the case of aperture ['diameter'] or focal length ['focal_length_value']
      and for orientation ['OM11', 'OM12',.... ,'OM33'] or for jones matrix
      ['JM11','JM12','JM21','JM22']
    dimensions:
      rank: 1
      dim: [[1, N_variables]]

  TRANSFERMATRIXTABLE(NXtrasnfer_matrix_table):
    doc: |
      Contains the datastructure, which relates beam properties of an 
      input and output beam as result of the input beam interaction
      with the optical element.
