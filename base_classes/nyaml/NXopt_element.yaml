  Properties of generic optical element in an experimental setup for optical spectroscopy.

  
NXopt_element(NXobject):

  previous_optical_elements: 
    doc: |
    Single element or list of elements pointing to the optical elements from which an optical beam originated to reach this optical element.
      This is used to describe a logical order of elements and for the whole setup.
      In this way, a "beam path" can be described (i.e., with starting point (light source) 
      and end point (photo detector)).

      Example: /entry/instrument/detector.
  element_purpose(NX_CHAR): 
    doc: |
      Description of the intended purpose of this optical element for
      the experimental setup.

  group(NX_CHAR): 
    doc: |
      Name of the group with which this element can be associated.
      i.e. if a group of elements is used for second harmonic generation,
      all these elements have the group name "second harmonic generation".
      Is used for simplified setup vizualization (or description?).


  POSITION(NXtransformation):
    #instantiable: User may use cartesian coordinates to give the opt element position
    # or as well a z-axis description.
    # Not sure: The idea was to use @depends_on to describe the position by the previous element
    # by only using distance and angles? Is there redundent information?
    doc: |
      Location and orientation of the optical element. Note that even a
      simple distance can be given as a translation.

      You can use the @depends_on to describe from which optial element
      the transformation needs to be applied.
