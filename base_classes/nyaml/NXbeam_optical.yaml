      Polarization vector on entering beamline component using Stokes notation
      
      The Stokes parameters are four components labelled I,Q,U,V or S_0,S_1,S_2,S_3.
      These are defined with the standard Nexus coordinate frame unless it is
      overridden by an NXtransformations field pointed to by a depends_on attribute.
      The last component, describing the circular polarization state, is positive
      for a right-hand circular state - that is the electric field vector rotates
      clockwise at the sample and over time when observed from the source.
      
      I (S_0) is the beam intensity (often normalized to 1). Q, U, and V scale
      linearly with the total degree of polarization, and indicate the relative
      magnitudes of the pure linear and circular orientation contributions.
      
      Q (S_1) is linearly polarized along the x axis (Q > 0) or y axis (Q < 0).
      
      U (S_2) is linearly polarized along the x==y axis (U > 0) or the
      -x==y axis (U < 0).
      
      V (S_3) is circularly polarized. V > 0 when the electric field vector rotates
      clockwise at the sample with respect to time when observed from the source;
      V < 0 indicates the opposite rotation.
