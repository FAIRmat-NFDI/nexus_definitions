NXdeflector(NXcomponent):
  type:
    doc: |
      Qualitative type of deflector with respect to the number of pole pieces
    enumeration: [dipole, quadrupole, hexapole, octupole]
  name(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Colloquial or short name for the deflector. For manufacturer names and
      identifiers use ``NXfabrication`` and ``identifierNAME``.
  voltage(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE
    doc: |
      Excitation voltage of the deflector. For dipoles it is a single number. For
      higher orders, it is an array.
  current(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_CURRENT
    doc: |
      Excitation current of the deflector. For dipoles it is a single number. For
      higher orders, it is an array.
