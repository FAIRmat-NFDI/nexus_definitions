  A generic optical beam, us in an experimental setup for optical spectroscopy.

  Characteristics of a beam, which is linked to two NXopt_element entries.
  A "logical direction" of the beam is defined by "prev_opt_element" and "next_opt_element"

  Example Names: incomming_1, incomming_2, outgoing_1, outgoing_2, input_1, output_1,
  souce_1, mirror_1

  Beam properties of the beam can be stored here: Intensity, polarization, divergence,
  diatmeter, electric field strength, spectral intensity distribution, ...

OPTICALBEAMS(NXbeam):
  previous_opt_element: 
    doc: |
      Gives the optival element, which this beam originated from.
      This defines, whether the beam in an "input" or "output" beam.
  next_opt_element: 
    doc: |
      Gives the optical element, which this beam will interact with next.
