        Details about eventually relevant named directions that may give
        reasons for anisotropies.
        
        The classical example is mechanical processing where one has to 
        specify which directions (e.g. rolling, transverse, and normal
        direction) align how with the direction of the base vectors of the 
        :ref:`NXsample_reference_frame`.
        
        It is assumed that the configuration is inspected by looking towards
        the sample surface. If a detector is involved, it is assumed that the
        configuration is inspected from a position that is located behind this
        detector.
        
        If any of these assumptions is not met, the user is required to
        explicitly state this.
        
        Reference DOI: 10.1016/j.matchar.2016.04.008 suggest to label the base
        the base vectors of this coordinate system as Xp, Yp, Zp.
