         Base class for recurrent information of components used inside an electron microscope.
         
         The electron microscope can be a real one or a virtual (simulated one).
         The key motivation behind this generalization is that in all cases a
         controlled electron beam is generated or simulated and then altered
         in a controlled manner for the purpose of studying physical interaction
         mechanism of the beam with matter (a real specimen or a simulated one).
         
         Using a common description for the real experiment in the lab and what is
         typically a simplification of it via a computer simulation has the benefit
         that many pieces of information can be stored in the same way and thus
         ease guiding users to find such information.

 Typically, the components of a system should all be related relative to
 each other and only one component should relate to the reference
 coordinate system.
this info keyword will take the role of a field
and even more an invalid one which can only be solved if no field any
longer must be named info or with making all info annotations a
an attribute of a docstring, like a comment-of-a-comment-->
