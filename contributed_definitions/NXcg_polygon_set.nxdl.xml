         Computational geometry description of a set of polygons in Euclidean space.
         
         Polygons are related are specialized polylines:
         
         * A polygon is a geometric primitive that is bounded by a closed polyline
         * All vertices of this polyline lay in the d-1 dimensional plane.
           whereas vertices of a polyline do not necessarily lay on a plane.
         * A polygon has at least three vertices.
         
         Each polygon is built from a sequence of vertices (points with identifiers).
         The members of a set of polygons may have a different number of vertices.
         Sometimes a collection/set of polygons is referred to as a soup of polygons.

    <!--#MK::ROI about the set ?
a set of polygons can be interpreted as a descriptor for an object
an, in TetGen terminology, piecewise-linear complex
defines_plc(NX_BOOLEAN):
doc: True, if the set describes a piecewise-linear complex.
#MK::each polygon could be given a role with respect to what the polygon
#MK::represents of the complex, this would allow to define a complex with
#MK::holes
vertices(NXcg_point_set):
doc: |
The set of vertices supporting the polygons.
The dimensionality of the point set and this polygon set are the same.
The number of vertices is arbitrary because polygons may different in
their number of edges.
Like it is the case for NXcg_triangle_set instances, individual
polygons may make edge contact in which case a lower number of vertices
suffices than naively expected from a summation of the edges.
Users are encouraged to reduce the vertex set to a set of unique vertices
as this can often turn out to allow for a more efficient storage
of the geometry data. It is also possible though to store
the vertices naively in which case vertices_are_unique is likely False.
vertices_are_unique(NX_BOOLEAN):
doc: |
If true indicates that the vertices are all placed at different positions
and have different identifiers, i.e. no points overlap or are counted twice.
number_of_vertices(NX_POSINT):
doc: |
Array which specifies of how many vertices each polygon is built.
The number of vertices represent the total number of vertices for
each polygon, irrespectively whether vertices are shared or not.
See the docstring for polygons for further details about how
a set with different polyline members should be stored.
unit: NX_UNITLESS
dimensions:
rank: 1
dimensions: [[1, c]]
##MK::there is nothing like value constraints... or minimum bitdepth
polygons(NX_INT):
doc: |
Array of identifiers from vertices which describe each polygon.
The first entry is the identifier of the start vertex of the first polyline,
followed by the second vertex of the first polyline, until the last vertex
of the polyline. Thereafter, the start vertex of the second polyline, and
so on and so forth. Using the (cumulated) counts in number_of_vertices,
the vertices of the n-th polyline can be accessed on the following
array index interval:
[$\sum_i = 0}^{i = n-1}$, $\sum_{i=0}^{i = n}$].
Users are advised to store the vertex identifiers, if possible and
ideally then for all of them, according to and using winding order.
If the winding_order field is given, it has to report the specific winding
order used.
