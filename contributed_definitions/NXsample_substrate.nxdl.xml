             NeXus positions components by applying a set of translations and rotations
             to apply to the component starting from 0, 0, 0. The order of these operations
             is critical and forms what NeXus calls a dependency chain. The depends_on
             field defines the path to the top most operation of the dependency chain or the
             string &quot;.&quot; if located in the origin. Usually these operations are stored in a
             NXtransformations group. But NeXus allows them to be stored anywhere.

             This is the group recommended for holding the chain of translation
             and rotation operations necessary to position the component within
             the instrument. The dependency chain may however traverse similar groups in
             other component groups
