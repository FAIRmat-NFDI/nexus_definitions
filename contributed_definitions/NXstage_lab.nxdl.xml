         Base class for a stage (lab) used to hold, orient, and prepare a specimen.
         
         Modern stages are multi-functional devices. Stages provide a controlled
         environment around the specimen or a part of it. Stages enable experimentalists
         to apply controlled external stimuli on the specimen.
         A stage_lab is a multi-purpose/-functional tool which is build from typically
         from multiple actuators, sensors, and other components.
         
         With such stages comes the need for storing various (meta)data
         that are generated while working and modifying the sample.
         
         Modern stages realize a hierarchy of components. Two examples are given to help
         clarify how NXstage_lab instances should be used: Take a specimen that is
         mounted on a multi-axial tilt rotation holder. This holder is fixed in the
         support unit which connects the holder to the rest of the
         instrument. Evidently different components are all considerable as stages.
         
         In another example, taken from atom probe microscopy, researchers may work
         with wire samples which are clipped into a larger fixing unit which enables
         a more careful specimen handling. Alternatively, a microtip is a silicon post
         upon which e.g. an atom probe specimen is mounted.
         Multiple microtips are grouped into a microtip array to conveniently enable
         loading of multiple specimens into the instrument with fewer operations.
         That microtip array is fixed on a holder. Fixture units in atom probe are known
         as stubs. Stubs in turn are positioned onto pucks. Pucks are then loaded onto
         carousels. A carousel is a carrier unit with which eventually entire sets of
         specimens can be moved in between parts of the microscope. All of these units
         can be considered stage_lab instances.
         
         The NXstage_lab base class reflects this hierarch.  To cover for an as flexible
         design of complex stages as possible, users should nest multiple instances of
         NXstage_lab according to their needs to reflect the differences between what
         they consider as the holder and what they consider is the stage.
         The alias field can be used to specify the community jargon if necessary.
         
         However, a much clearer approach to reflect the hierarchy of all NXstage_lab
         instances is postfix each instance named stage_lab with integers starting
         from 1 as the top level unit.
         In the microtip example one could thus use stage_lab1 for the microtip,
         stage_lab2 for the microtip array, stage_lab3 holder, etc.
         The depends_on keyword should be used to additional clarify the hierarchy
         especially when users decide to not follow the above-mentioned postfixing
         notation or when is not obvious from the postfixes which stage_lab is at
         which level of the stage_lab hierarchy.

NEW ISSUE: add temperature control units and components to apply external stimuli
NEW ISSUE: on the specimen such as NXmech_testing_unit and NXfurnace, NXreaction_cell
NEW ISSUE: by contrast, the purpose and design of so-called nano/or micromanipulators,
i.e. automatable devices to perform e.g. site-specific lift out, procedures warrants
to define an own class NXspecimen_manipulator given this is nothing else than
miniature robot arm essential one could also think about creating an own NXrobotarm class,
below are two examples of such tools as they are used in FIB and SEMs-->
