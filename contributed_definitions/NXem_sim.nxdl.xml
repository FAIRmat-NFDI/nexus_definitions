         Base class for simulating electron microscopy relevant beam-matter interaction.
         
         The concept behind this base class is to keep it as generic as possible
         that simulations of electron/ion beam interaction with matter can be
         represented. This base class is envisioned as the twin of the NXem_msr base
         class. It is an attempt to test the idea if at some point one might even
         the same base class template to describe measurements and computer simulations
         of electron microscopy. This idea is attractive because the only practical
         difference between a description of a measurement with a microscope and a
         computer simulation of that microscope comes typically with substantial
         simplifications of the simulated setup. These simplification can be the
         optical setup, typically the ignoring of the fact that the electron beam
         is produced by a complex setup of lenses while in simulations often single
         lenses are considered. Dynamics of the environment like temperature fluctuation
         in a lab, vibrations, users, and multiple detectors are typically either ignored
         or reduced in complexity and number and coming with idealizations to keep the
         simulations focused on the specific reason questions and efficient.
