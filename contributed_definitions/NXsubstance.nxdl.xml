             * Only recognized element symbols may be used.
             * Each element symbol is followed by a 'count' number. A count of '1' may be omitted.
             * A space or parenthesis must separate each cluster of (element symbol + count).
             * Where a group of elements is enclosed in parentheses, the multiplier for the
               group must follow the closing parentheses. That is, all element and group
               multipliers are assumed to be printed as subscripted numbers.
             * Unless the elements are ordered in a manner that corresponds to their chemical
               structure, the order of the elements within any group or moiety depends on
               whether or not carbon is present.
             * If carbon is present, the order should be:	  
               - C, then H, then the other elements in alphabetical order of their symbol.
               - If carbon is not present, the elements are listed purely in alphabetic order of their symbol.
               
             * This is the *Hill* system used by Chemical Abstracts.
