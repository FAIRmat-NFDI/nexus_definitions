         A generic optical beam, used in an experimental setup for optical spectroscopy.
         
         
         Characteristics of a beam which is linked to two NXopt_element entries.
         
         A "logical direction" of the beam is defined by "prev_opt_element" and "next_opt_element"
         
         Example Names: incoming_1, incoming_2, outgoing_1, outgoing_2, input_1, output_1,
         
         souce_1, mirror_1
         
         Properties of the beam can be stored here: Intensity, polarization, divergence,
         
         diameter, electric field strength, spectral intensity distribution, ...

    <field name="previous_opt_element">
        <doc>
             Indicates the optical element from which this beam originates.
             This defines, whether the beam in an "input" or "output" beam.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="next_opt_element">
        <doc>
             Gives the optical element which this beam will interact with next.
