         Base class to detail a coordinate system (CS).
         
         Whenever possible an instance of coordinate system should be used as
         a member in an NXcoordinate_system_set and the name of the instance
         should be this alias. This may support a process whereby jargon
         when talking about coordinate systems and conventions may become
         cleaner for users because it is not evident for people outside a lab
         that the terms tip space, specimen space, refer to the same coordinate
         system. This is an example of jargon used in e.g. the field of atom
         probe tomography.

             Human-readable field telling where the origin of this CS is.
             Exemplar values could be *left corner of the lab bench*, *door-handle*
             *pinhole through which the electron beam exists the pole piece*.
             *barycenter of the triangle*, *center of mass of the stone*.
