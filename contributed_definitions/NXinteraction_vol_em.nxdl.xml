         Base class for storing details about a modelled shape of the interaction volume
         between sets or individually charged particles (electrons or ions) and matter.
         
         Computer models like Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics / electron or ion beam
         interaction simulations can be used to qualify and/or quantify the shape of
         the interaction volume as summary statistics or via single particle resolved
         trajectory sets.
