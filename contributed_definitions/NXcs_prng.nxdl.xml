         Computer science description of pseudo-random number generator.
         
         The purpose of such metadata is to identify if exactly the same sequence
         can be reproduced, like for a PRNG or not (for a true physically random source).

        <doc>
             Physical approach or algorithm whereby random numbers are generated.

             Number of initial draws from the PRNG after its initialized with the seed.
             These initial draws are discarded in an effort to equilibrate the
             sequence. If no warmup was performed or if warmup procedures are unclear,
             users should set the value to zero.

    <!--one could add spectral properties but this is usually well documented in the PRNG literature
one could also think about making reference to the NIST PRNG test suite to qualify the PRNG-->
