         Transfermatrix relationship between N input beams and M output beams.
         It contains a table with the relevant matricis to be used for different
         transmissitted properties (such as polarization, intensity, phase).
         
         Data structure for all transfermatrices of an optical element in a setup.
         For each combination of N input and M output beams and for L physical
         concept (i.e. beam intensity), one matrix can be defined.
         
         In this way, the transfermatrix table has the dimension NxM.
         
         For each entry, in this transfermatrix, there are L formalisms.
         Each formalism has the dimension math:`dim(L_i)xdim(L_i)`,
         whereby math:`L_i` is the specific physical concept (Intensity, polarization, direction).
         
         A beamsplitter with two input laser beams can have a total of
         four transfermatrices (2 Input x 2 Output).
         
         The dimension of the transfermatrix depends on the parameters.
         Examples are:
         1x1 for intensity/power
         2x2 for jones formalism
         3x3 for direction
