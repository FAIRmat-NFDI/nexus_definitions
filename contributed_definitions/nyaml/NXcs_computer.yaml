type: group
NXcs_computer(NXobject):
  name(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Given name/alias to the computing system, e.g. MyDesktop.
  operating_system(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Name of the operating system, e.g. Windows, Linux, Mac, Android.
    \@version:
      doc: |
        Version plus build number, commit hash, or description of an ever
        persistent resource where the source code of the program and build
        instructions can be found so that the program can be configured in
        such a manner that the result file is ideally recreatable yielding
        the same results.
  # difference e.g. in Win11 between hardware ID, UUID, and device ID
  uuid(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Ideally a (globally) unique persistent identifier of the computer, i.e.
      the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) of the computing node.
  # when it comes to performance monitoring
  processing(NXobject):
    doc: |
      Details about the system of processing units e.g. (classical) processing units (CPUs),
      coprocessor, graphic cards, accelerator processing units or a system of these.
    (NXcircuit):
      doc: |
        Granularizing the processing units. Typical examples, a desktop computer
        with a single CPU one could describe using one instance of NXcircuit.
        A dual-socket server one could describe using two instances NXcircuit
        A server with two dual-socket server nodes one could describe with
        four instances of NXcircuit surplus a field with their level in the hierarchy.
      type(NX_CHAR):
        doc: |
          General type of the processing unit
        enumeration: [cpu, gpu, fpga, other]

        enumeration: [ddr4, ddr5]
      max_physical_capacity(NX_POSINT):
        doc: |
