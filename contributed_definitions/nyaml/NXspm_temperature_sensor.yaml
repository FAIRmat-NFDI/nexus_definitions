  The :ref:`NXspm_temperature_sensor` class describes a temperature sensor
  used in scanning probe microscopy (SPM) experiments. It includes fields
  for the temperature measurement, calibration, and associated data.
type: group
NXspm_temperature_sensor(NXsensor):
  temperature(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_TEMPERATURE
    doc: |
      The obtained average temperature of the sensor.
  target_temperature(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_TEMPERATURE
    doc: |
      The target temperature of the sensor, which is the desired temperature
      to be maintained during the experiment.
  temp_offset_value(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_TEMPERATURE
    doc: |
      The offset temperature of the sensor, which will be added to obtained correct the
      measured temperature.
  TEMPERATUREchannel(NX_CHAR):
    nameType: partial
    doc: |
      The name of the channel that handles the temperature measurement.
  calibration(NXcalibration):
    doc: |
      Calibration of the temperature measurement.
    coefficient(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_ANY
      doc: |
        The coefficient of the calibration.
  (NXdata):
    nameType: any
