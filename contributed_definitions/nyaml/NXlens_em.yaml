  Base class for an electro-magnetic lens or a compound lens.
  
  For :ref:`NXtransformations` the origin of the coordinate system is placed
  in the center of the lens (its polepiece, pinhole, or another
  point of reference). The origin should be specified in the :ref:`NXtransformations`.
  
  For details of electro-magnetic lenses in the literature

  value(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Descriptor for the lens excitation when the exact technical details
      are unknown or not directly controllable as the control software of
      the microscope does not enable or was not configured to display these
      values (for end users).
      
      Although this value does not document the exact physical voltage or
      excitation, it can still give useful context to reproduce the lens
      setting, provided a properly working instrument and software sets the lens
      into a similar state to the technical level possible when no more
      information is available physically or accessible legally.
    unit: NX_ANY
  mode(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Descriptor for the operation mode of the lens when other details are not
      directly controllable as the control software of the microscope
      does not enable or is not configured to display these values.
      
      Like value, the mode can only be interpreted for a specific microscope
      but can still be useful to guide users as to how to repeat the measurement.

  voltage(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Excitation voltage of the lens.
      
      For dipoles it is a single number.
      For higher order multipoles, it is an array.
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE
  current(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Excitation current of the lens.
      
      For dipoles it is a single number.
      For higher-order multipoles, it is an array.
    unit: NX_CURRENT

      Qualitative type of lens with respect to the number of pole pieces.
    enumeration: [single, double, quadrupole, hexapole, octupole, dodecapole]
