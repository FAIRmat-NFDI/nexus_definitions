  Base class definition for bias spectroscopy.
  
  The Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS), an extension of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM),
  is used to measure I(V) curves at each point of the surface. The dI/dV(V) can also be measured
  with the help of numerical differentiation of the I(V) curve or from Lock-in amplifier.
type: group
NXbias_spectroscopy(NXobject):
  measurement_type:
    doc: |
      The measurement of the I(V) curve can come in two ways:
        1. Constant Spacing: The bias voltage is swept from the start to the end with a constant
           spacing between the tip and surface.
        2. Variadic Spacing: The bias voltage is swept from the start to the end in a discretized spacing
           between the tip and surface.
    enumeration: [constant_spacing, variadic_spacing]
  probe_speed(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_VELOCITY
    doc: |
      The speed of probe during the sweep (in variadic_spacing). In the variadic spacing process, the probe moves to the
      different distances from the surface with a constant velocity.
  z_offset(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    doc: |
      Initial position of the probe before starting the sweep.
  z_positions(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    doc: |
      The position of the probe during the sweep. In the variadic spacing process, the probe moves to the
      different z positions (say nZ positions) and perform a full sweep on individual position. 
    dimensions:
      rank: 1
      dim: [1, nZ]
  mudulation_signal:
    doc: |
      The modulation signal is used to modulate the DC voltage applied to the surface. The modulation signal
      can be a sine wave, square wave, or triangle wave.
    enumeration: [sine, square, triangle]
  modulation_amplitude(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE
    doc: |
      The amplitude of the AC voltage (modulation voltage) that is applied to the DC voltage 
      subjected to the surface.
  modulation_frequency(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_FREQUENCY
    doc: |
      The frequency of the AC voltage (modulation voltage) that is applied to the DC voltage 
      subjected to the surface.
  z_avg_time(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_TIME
    doc: |
      The time that is needed to stabilize the probe position at a desired distance from 
      the subject of scanning. 
  settling_time(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_TIME
    doc: |
      Time to wait after changing the bias, in the sweep process, to the next level and before
      starting to acquire data.
  forward_sweep(NX_BOOLEAN):
    doc: |
      The sweep variable, especially voltage, can change from lower to higher value and vice-versa. 

      If the sweep variable changes from lower to higher value, then it is called a forward sweep else backward sweep.
  reset_bias(NX_BOOLEAN):
    doc: |
      Choose true if the bias voltage is reset to the initial value before each sweep.
  number_of_sweeps(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      The number of sweeps to measure and average in one sweep round.
  sweep_start_voltage(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE
    doc: |
      The first bias values of the sweep.
  sweep_end_voltage(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE
    doc: |
      The last bias values of the sweep.
  channels:
    doc: |
      A list of selected channels to collect data.
  DATA(NXdata):
    doc: |
      Use this group to store the data from several channels as well as for several z-positions.

      The data I(V) and dI/dV(V) concerning the forward sweep or backward sweep should be stored in 
      this group.

#              If chosen, the Bias voltage resets to its initial value (before the sweep initiation) at 
#              the conclusion of the spectroscopy measurement. When this option is not selected, the Bias 
#              voltage maintains the last value acquired during the sweep. This functionality proves 
#              beneficial, especially when combining multiple sweep segments. As an illustration of an 
#              automated measurement: turn off the z-Controller, commence spectroscopy sweep segments (
#              forward sweep only, without resetting the bias), restore the bias to its initial value, 
#              and then turn on the z-Controller.
