    doc: |
      The measurement of the I(V) curve can come in two ways:
      1. Constant Spacing: The bias voltage is swept from the start to the end with a constant
      spacing between the tip and surface.
      2. Variadic Spacing: The bias voltage is swept from the start to the end in a discretized
      spacing between the tip and surface.
