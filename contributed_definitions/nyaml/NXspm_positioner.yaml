      This controller's task is to continuously adjust the Z position of tip (e.g., in topography scan in
      STM/STS experiment) in order to keep the selected control signal as close as possible to the Set
      Point. Different control signals lead to different controller's behavior.
      
      The second PID feedback loop intends to position the tip in the Z direction.
      
      p_gain (proportional gain) from z_controller refers to K_p value from PID controller.
      i_gain (integral gain) from z_controller refers to K_i value from PID controller.
      setpoint from z_controller refers to setpoint from PID controller.
      
      Usually, the same controller, (z_controller) will be used for positioning the tip in three dimensional
      space. In this case, the controller coefficients (proportional, integral, differential) and other characteristic
      constants will be the same. Otherwise, for separate controllers positioning the tip in 3D space use the
      :ref:`feedback </NXspm_positioner/actuator/feedback>` controller in actuator.

      nameType: specified
      unit: NX_TIME

        The derivative time constant of the derivative part of the PID controller. Proportional Derivative constant
        K_d can be expressed as K_d = gain / D_t.
    I_t(NX_NUMBER):
      nameType: specified
      unit: NX_TIME
      doc: |
        The integral time constant of the integral part of the PID controller. Proportional Integral constant
        K_i can be expressed as K_i = gain / I_t.
    z(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_LENGTH

        To indicate the relative tip position z between tip and sample. The tip position
        can also be varied when the z_controller is not running.
    set_point(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_ANY
      doc: |
        The set point for the z-controller to be fixed and the target value could be
        height or current.
