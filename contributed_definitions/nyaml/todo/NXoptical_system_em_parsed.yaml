  # NEW ISSUE: for now used to store difficult to place entries
  # NEW ISSUE: all the definitions here should better be backed up by the
  # work of the HMC EM glossary activities
  camera_length(R):
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    doc: |
      Citing the JEOL TEM glossary this is *an effective distance from a specimen
      to a plane where an observed diffraction pattern is formed*.
  magnification(R):  # R+ otherwise it is demagnification
    unit: NX_DIMENSIONLESS
    doc: |
      The factor of enlargement of the apparent size, not physical size, of an object.
  defocus(R):
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    doc: |
      The defocus aberration constant (oftentimes referred to as C_1_0).
      See respective details in NXaberration class instances.
  semi_convergence_angle(R):
    unit: NX_ANGLE
    doc: |
      Citing the JEOL TEM glosssary this is the value *when a cone shaped,
      convergent electron beam illuminates a specimen, the semi-angle of the cone
      is termed convergence angle.*
  field_of_view(R):
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    doc: |
      The extent of the observable parts of the specimen given the current
      magnification and other settings of the instrument.
  working_distance(R+):
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    doc: |
      Citing `Globalsino <https://www.globalsino.com/EM/page4586.html>`_ this is
      *a distance between the specimen and the lower pole piece in SEM system*.
  beam_current(R+):
    unit: NX_CURRENT
    # see AXON Dose monitoring paper doi:10.1017/S1551929522000840
    # this is the nominal dose rate e-/(angstrom^2*s)
    doc: |
      Beam current as measured relevant for the illumination of the specimen.
      Users should specify further details like how the beam current was measured
      using the beam_current_description field.
  # replace with a dedicated base class to describe the dose rate, accumulated dose, dose rate history
  # based on the AXON Dose monitoring suggestions, for this one could also have an NXdose_monitoring base class
  # alternatively as that dose monitoring instrument as it is also described in the paper
  # is a modified Faraday cup sensor one could also wrap that detector in this base dose monitoring base class
  beam_current_description:
    doc: |
      Specify further details how the beam current was measured or estimated.
