  Application definition for temperature-dependent IV curve measurements, #CAP with a focus on bias spectroscopy in scanning tunneling microscopy.
  
  In this application definition, times should be specified always together
  with an UTC offset.
 
  This is the application definition describing temperature (T) dependent current voltage (IV) curve
  measurements. For this a temperature is set. After reaching the temperature,
  a voltage sweep is performed. For each voltage a current is measured.
  Then, the next desired temperature is set and an IV measurement is performed.

        There should also be two more fields called temperature and voltage containing the setpoint values.
        There should also be a field with an array of rank equal to the number of different temperature setpoints and each child's dimension
        equal to the number of voltage setpoints.

        Start time(NXlog) (e.g.23.11.2022 18:55:16) # Timestamp of the moment when the acquisition starts by pressing the Start button.
        Bias Spectroscopy>Z offset(NXbias) (m) (e.g.0E+0) # Offset added to the initial averaged position Zaver before starting to sweep. This parameter is disabled when Z-Controller to Hold is deselected in the Advanced section. The LED “Alt” next to the Z offset indicates if an alternate Z-controller setpoint is enabled.
        Bias Spectroscopy>1st Settling time(NXbias) (s) (e.g.2.1E-3) # See the "Settling time (s)" below.
        Bias Spectroscopy>Settling time(NXbias) (s) (e.g.2.1E-3) # See the "Settling time (s)" below.
        Bias Spectroscopy>Integration time(NXbias) (s) (e.g.150E-6) # Time during which the data are acquired and averaged.
        Bias Spectroscopy>End Settling time(NXbias) (s) (e.g.4E-3) # Time to wait after the sweep has finished and the bias is ramped to the initial value.
        Bias Spectroscopy>Z control time(NXbias) (s) (e.g.200E-3) # Time during which the Z-Controller is enabled once a sweep has finished. When averaging multiple sweeps (i.e. Sweeps>1), the Z-Controller is enabled for this duration between each sweep. After the last sweep, it will wait the specified time before continuing a running scan. This ensures each sweep reliably starts from the same position. This parameter is disabled when Z-Controller to Hold is deselected in the Advanced section.
        Bias Spectroscopy>Max Slew rate(NXbias) (V/s) (e.g.1E+0) # Maximum rate at which the bias changes (before, during and after sweeping).
        Bias Spectroscopy>backward sweep(NXbias) (e.g.TRUE) # Select whether to measure the backward (return) sweep or the forward only.
        Bias Spectroscopy>Z-controller hold(NXbias) (e.g.TRUE # Select whether to set the Z-Controller on hold (i.e. disabled) during the sweep. It is selected by default. When deselected, Z-offset and Z control time parameters are disabled.
        Z-Controller>Controller name(NXpositioner) (e.g.log Current) # Controller name. This name which will be displayed at places where you can select a controller.
        Z-Controller>Controller status(NXpositioner) (e.g.OFF) # ON/OFF
        Z-Controller>Setpoint(NXpositioner) (e.g.50E-12) # Set Point is the desired value of the control signal. It can be set by editing the number or using the slider bar. Click the "Set" button above the input field to use the actual value as Set Point. The slider shows the Set Point as well as the current value.
        Z-Controller>Setpoint unit(NXpositioner) (e.g.A) # Angstrom
        Z-Controller>P gain(NXpositioner) (e.g.6E-12) # The Type switches controller parameters between P/I (proportional gain/integral gain) and P/T (proportional gain/time constant). The formula for the controller in the frequency domain is: G(s) = P + I/s = P(1 + 1/(Ts)). The integral gain and time constant are related as follows: I = P/T.
        Z-Controller>I gain(NXpositioner) (e.g.39.8241E-9) # See "Z-Controller>P gain" below.
        Z-Controller>Time const(NXpositioner) (s) (e.g.150.662E-6) # See "Z-Controller>P gain" below.
        Z-Controller>TipLift(NXpositioner) (m) (e.g.0E+0) # Lifts the tip by the specified amount when then controller is switched off. This can be a positive or a negative number, i.e. the tip can also be moved towards the sample. Be careful with sign and value when using this feature.
        Z-Controller>Switch off delay(NXpositioner) (s) (e.g.0E+0) # Use this parameter for a reproducible position when switching off the Z-controller. When >0 and the Z-controller is switched off, it doesn't switch off immediately but continues to run for the specified time and averages the Z position.
