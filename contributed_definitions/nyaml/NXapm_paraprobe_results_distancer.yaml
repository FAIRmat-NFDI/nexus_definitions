        Given name of the program/software/tool with which this NeXus
        (configuration) file was generated.
      \@version:
        doc: |
          Ideally program version plus build number, or commit hash or description
          of ever persistent resources where the source code of the program and
          build instructions can be found so that the program can be configured
          ideally in such a manner that the result of this computational process
          is recreatable in the same deterministic manner.
    analysis_identifier:
      doc: |
        Ideally, a (globally persistent) unique identifier for referring
        to this analysis.

      doc: |
        Possibility for leaving a free-text description about this analysis.
    start_time(NX_DATE_TIME):
      doc: |
        ISO 8601 formatted time code with local time zone offset to UTC
        information included when the analysis behind this results file
        was started, i.e. the paraprobe-tool executable started as a process.
    end_time(NX_DATE_TIME):
      doc: |
        ISO 8601 formatted time code with local time zone offset to UTC
        information included when the analysis behind this results file
        were completed and the paraprobe-tool executable exited as a process.
    config_filename:
      doc: |
        The absolute path and name of the config file for this analysis.
      \@version:

          tracking provenance.
    results_path:
      exists: optional
      doc: |
        Path to the directory where the tool should store NeXus/HDF5 results
        of this analysis. If not specified results will be stored in the
        current working directory.
    status:
      doc: |
        A statement whether the paraprobe-tool executable managed to
        process the analysis or failed prematurely.
        
        This status is written to the results file after the end_time
        at which point the executable must not compute any analysis.
        Only when this status message is present and shows `success`, the
        user should consider the results. In all other cases it might be
        that the executable has terminated prematurely or another error
        occurred.

          The tool can be used to compute the analytical distance of each ion

              The unsigned integer array representing the content of the mask.
              If padding is used the padded bits are set to 0. The mask is for
              convenience always as large as the entire dataset as it will
              be stored compressed anyway. The convenience feature with this
              is that then the mask can be decoded with numpy and mirrored
              against the evaporation_id array and one immediately can filter
              out all points that were used by the paraprobe.
              The length of the array adds to the next unsigned integer
              if the number of ions in the dataset is not an integer
              multiple of the bitdepth.

            A bitmask which identifies which of the triangles in the set
            were considered. Usually these are all but sometimes users may
            wish to filter certain portions of the triangles out.
            If window_triangles is not provided it means that
            all triangles were taken.
          number_of_triangles(NX_UINT):

            A bitmask which identifies which of the distance values
            can be assumed to have a consistent sign because the closest
            triangle had a consistent outer unit normal defined.
            For points whose bit is set 0 the distance is correct but the
            sign is not reliable.
