        The reference frame for the sample surface reference is used for
        identifying positions on a (virtual) image which is formed by
        information collected from an electron beam scanning the
        sample surface. We assume the configuration is inspected by
        looking towards the sample surface from a position that is
        located behind the detector.

        The sample surface reference frame has coordinates Xs, Ys, Zs.
        In three dimensions these coordinates are not necessarily
        located on the surface of the sample as there are multiple
        faces/sides of the sample. Most frequently though the coordinate
        system here is used to define the surface which the electron
        beam scans.
