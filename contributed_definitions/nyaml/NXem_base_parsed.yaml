# template to be used for an application definition
doc: |
  Base class for structuring data and metadata of electron microscopy research.
  
  This base class combines a method-specific and technical design base classes
  to enable users a storage and parameterized description of pieces of information
  collected when performing electron microscopy research.
  
  The base class here shows all possible branches without making any statements
  as to which of these have to be used in an instance. Thereby, the base class
  provides a template how to name and structure concepts in a hierarchy
  to support finding information and reducing the need for renaming and
  restructuring information for a research field where many scientists perform
  very specific research but all use controlled electron beams to study
  electron beam matter interaction to explore physical mechanisms and phenomena
  or to characterize materials.
# flesh out the description of that to read the docs, because currently the
# description on the NeXus front-page is overwhelming
# considering what we learned from the diataxis workshop we write here a
# specification neither a how to nor a tutorial which explains all the context
# because we address here developers of software

      A collection of all programs and libraries which are consider relevant
      to understand with which software tools this NeXus file instance was
      generated. Ideally, to enable a binary recreation from the input data.
      
      Examples include the name and version of the libraries
      used to write the instance. Ideally, the software which writes these
      NXprogram instances also includes the version of the set of NeXus classes
      i.e. the specific set of base classes, application definitions, and 
      contributed definitions with which the here described concepts can
      be resolved.
      
      For the `pynxtools library <https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/pynxtools>`_
      which is used by the `NOMAD <https://nomad-lab.eu/nomad-lab>`_
      research data management system, it makes sense to store e.g. the GitHub
      repository commit and respective submodule references used.
  # each NeXus file instance should have a default plot
  # however as there are cases when this cannot be assured we cannot
  # make the default required, one example is e.g. a NeXus instance
  # where scientists just store conventions without a default plot
  cs_profiling(NXcs_profiling):
    doc: |
      The configuration of the I/O writer software (e.g. `pynxtools <https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/pynxtools>`_)
      which was used to generate this NeXus file instance.
  (NXentry):  # means ENTRY(NXentry)
    \@version:
      doc: |
        An at least as strong as SHA256 hashvalue of the file
        which specifies the application definition.
    definition:
      doc: |
        NeXus NXDL schema to which this file conforms.
      enumeration: [NXem]
    experiment_identifier:
      doc: |
        Ideally, a (globally) unique persistent identifier
        for referring to this experiment.
        
        An experiment should be understood in that this can be an experiment
        in reality or a computer simulation because also the latter is an
        experiment (see the Cambridge Dictionary experiment: 
        *a test done in order to find out something, eg if an idea is correct*).
        
        The identifier is usually issued by the facility, laboratory,
        or the principle investigator. The identifier enables to link
        experiments/simulations to e.g. proposals.
    experiment_description:
      doc: |
        Free-text description about the experiment.
        
        Users are strongly advised to parameterize their description of the
        experiment by using the respective base classes instead of writing prose
        into this field.
        
        The reason is that such free-text field is difficult to machine-interpret.
        The motivation behind keeping this field for now is to learn through
        the information entered in this field in how far the current base
        classes are incomplete.
    start_time(NX_DATE_TIME):
      doc: |
        ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information included
        when the microscope session started. If the application demands that time
        codes in this section of the application definition should only be used
        for specifying when the experiment was performed - and the exact
        duration is not relevant - this start_time field should be used.
        
        Often though it is useful to specify a time interval via setting both
        a start_time and an end_time as this enables more detailed bookkeeping and
        interpretation of the experiment.
      info: |
        The user should be aware that even with having both time instances specified,
        it may not be possible to infer how long the experiment took or for how
        long data were acquired.
        
        More detailed timing data over the course of the experiment have
        to be collected to compute this. These computations can take
        advantage of individual time stamps in NXevent_data_em instances.
    end_time(NX_DATE_TIME):
      doc: |
        ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC included when
        the microscope session ended.

        if desired).

      identifier:
        doc: |
          Ideally, (globally) unique persistent identifier which distinguishes
          the specimen from all others and especially the predecessor/origin
          from where the specimen was cut. 
          
          This field must not be used for an alias! Instead, use name.
          
          In cases where multiple specimens were loaded into the microscope,
          the identifier has to for the specific sample, whose results are stored
          by this NXentry instance, because a single NXentry should be used only for
          the characterization of a single specimen.
          
          Details about the specimen preparation should be stored in the
          sample history.
      sample_history:
        doc: |
          Ideally, a reference to or a (globally) unique persistent identifier,
          whereby a data artifact is specified which documents ideally as many
          details of the material, its microstructure, and its 
          thermo-chemo-mechanical processing/preparation history as possible.
          
          The sample_history is the identifier which enables to trace what happened
          before the experiment which is documented here.
          
          In the case that a detailed history of the sample is not available,
          use this field as a free-text description to specify a sub-set of the
          entire sample history, i.e. what you would consider are the key steps
          and relevant information to report about the specimen,
          its material, microstructure, thermo-chemo-mechanical processing state,
          and the details of the preparation.
          
          Specific details about eventual physically-connected material like
          embedding resin should be documented ideally also in the sample_history.
          If all fails, the description field can be used but it is strongly
          discouraged because it leads to eventually non-machine-actionable
          data.
      preparation_date(NX_DATE_TIME):
        doc: |
          ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information
          when the specimen was prepared.
          
          Ideally report the end of the preparation, i.e. the last known time
          the measured specimen surface was actively prepared. Usually this should
          be a part of the sample history, i.e. the sample is imagined handed over
          for analysis.
          
          Knowing when the specimen was exposed to e.g. specific atmosphere is
          especially required for environmentally sensitive material such as
          hydrogen charged specimens or experiments including tracers with a
          short half time. Additional time stamps prior to preparation_date
          should better be placed in resources which
          describe the sample_history. To resolve these resources is the
          purpose of sample_history.
      name:
        doc: |
          An alias of used to refer to the specimen to please readability for humans.
      atom_types:
        doc: |
          List of comma-separated elements from the periodic table that are
          contained in the sample. If the sample substance has multiple
          components, all elements from each component must be included in
          `atom_types`.
          
          The purpose of the field is to offer materials database systems an
          opportunity to parse the relevant elements without having to interpret
          these from the sample history.
      # NEW ISSUE: use Andrea and MarkusK groups for describing the geometry of the sample
      thickness(R+):
        unit: NX_LENGTH
        doc: |
          (Measured) sample thickness. The information is recorded to qualify
          if the beam used was likely able to shine through the specimen.
          For scanning electron microscopy, in many cases the specimen is much
          thicker than what is illuminatable by the electron beam.
          In this case the value should be set to the actual thickness of
          the specimen viewed for an illumination situation where the nominal
          surface normal of the specimen is parallel to the optical axis.
      # \@units: nm
      # NEW ISSUE: error estimates of the thickness and origin, i.e. how the value was obtained would be useful
      # NEW ISSUE: error model
      # NEW ISSUE: the KIT/SCC SEM, TEM schemata further qualify samples whether they are conductive e/ibeam sensitive
      # etc. The problem with this is that beam sensitivity is too vague but spatio-temporal electron dose integral dependent
      # KIT/SCC distinguish further conductivity and magnetic properties. While the motivation is clear, making

      # if plasma cleaning is done outside the EM than its certainly history, if it happens inside the EM
      # are the ibeam description capabilities not sufficient enough?

        doc: |
          (Measured) density of the specimen.
        info: |
          For multi-layered specimens this field should only be used to describe
          the density of the excited volume. For scanning electron microscopy
          the usage of this field is discouraged and instead an instance of an 
          :ref:`NXinteraction_vol_em` within individual :ref:`NXevent_data_em`
          instances can provide a cleaner description of the relevant details
          why one may wish to store the density of the specimen.
