  Description of region for peak fitting (i.e., in an NXpeak_model).
  
  Used for descibring a subpart of the abscissa (in 2D spectra) that is
  used for fitting.
type: group
NXfit_region(NXobject):
  label(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Human-readable label which specifies which concept/entity
      the region represents/identifies.
  start(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_ANY
    doc: |
      Minimal value of the defined region.
  stop(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_ANY
    doc: |
      Minimal value of the defined region.
  (NXcollection):
    doc: |
      In the case of an analytical description (or if peak_model is other) this
      collection holds parameter of (and eventually) the functional form.
      For example in the case of Gaussians mu, sigma, cut-off values,
      and background intensity are relevant parameter.
