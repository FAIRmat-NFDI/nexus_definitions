  Base class for storing details about a modelled shape of the interaction volume
  between sets or individually charged particles (electrons or ions) and matter.
  
  Computer models like Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics / electron or ion beam
  interaction simulations can be used to qualify and/or quantify the shape of
  the interaction volume as summary statistics or via single particle resolved
  trajectory sets.

  Explicit or implicit descriptions are possible.
  
  * An implicit description is via a set of electron/specimen interactions
    represented ideally as trajectory data from the computer simulation.
  * An explicit description is via an iso-contour surface using either
    a simulation grid or a triangulated surface mesh of the approximated
    iso-contour surface evaluated at specific threshold values.
    Iso-contours could be computed from electron or particle fluxes through
    an imaginary control surface (the iso-surface).
    Threshold values can be defined by particles passing through a unit control
    volume (electrons) or energy-levels (e.g. the case of X-rays).
    Details depend on the model.
  * Another explicit description is via theoretical models which may
    be relevant e.g. for X-ray spectroscopy
  
  Further details on how the interaction volume can be quantified
  is available in the literature for example:

#          The interaction volume is mainly relevant in scanning electron microscopy

#          through the specimen.

#          interaction simulations can be used to qualify and/or quantify the shape of
