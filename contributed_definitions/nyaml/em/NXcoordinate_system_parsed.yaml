  Base class to detail a coordinate system (CS).
  
  Whenever possible an instance of coordinate system should be used as
  a member in an NXcoordinate_system_set and the name of the instance
  should be this alias. This may support a process whereby jargon
  when talking about coordinate systems and conventions may become
  cleaner for users because it is not evident for people outside a lab
  that the terms tip space, specimen space, refer to the same coordinate
  system. This is an example of jargon used in e.g. the field of atom
  probe tomography.

      Human-readable field telling where the origin of this CS is.
      Exemplar values could be *left corner of the lab bench*, *door-handle*
      *pinhole through which the electron beam exists the pole piece*.
      *barycenter of the triangle*, *center of mass of the stone*.

    enumeration: [right_handed, left_handed]
  x(R):
    doc: |
      Base unit vector along the first axis which spans the coordinate system.
      This axis is frequently referred to as the x-axis in real space and
      the i-axis in reciprocal space.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    dim: (3,)
  y(R):
    doc: |
      Base unit vector along the second axis which spans the coordinate system.
      This axis is frequently referred to as the y-axis in real space and
      the j-axis in reciprocal space.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    dim: (3,)
  z(R):
    doc: |
      Base unit vector along the second axis which spans the coordinate system.
      This axis is frequently referred to as the z-axis in real space and
      the k-axis in reciprocal space.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    dim: (3,)
