  Base class for recurrent information of components used inside an electron microscope.
  
  The electron microscope can be a real one or a virtual (simulated one).
  The key motivation behind this generalization is that in all cases a
  controlled electron beam is generated or simulated and then altered
  in a controlled manner for the purpose of studying physical interaction
  mechanism of the beam with matter (a real specimen or a simulated one).
  
  Using a common description for the real experiment in the lab and what is
  typically a simplification of it via a computer simulation has the benefit
  that many pieces of information can be stored in the same way and thus
  ease guiding users to find such information.

  The key idea that an electron microscope is a beam line is supported by the fact
  that frequently electron microscopes use hardware components from different
  manufacturers where sometime their control uses an own software package.
  Examples are furnaces attached to the stage or scanbox.
  
  One example is `point Electronic GmbH <https://www.pointelectronic.de>`_
  which build hardware and software components for microscopes.

      Typically, the components of a system should all be related relative to
      each other and only one component should relate to the reference
      coordinate system.
