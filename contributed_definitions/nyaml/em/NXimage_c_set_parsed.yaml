  Specialized base class container for reporting a set of images in reciprocal space.
info: |
  In practice complex numbers are encoded via some formatted pair of real values.
  In practice fast Algorithms for computing Fourier Transformations (FFT) are
  used to encode images in reciprocal (frequency) space. FFT libraries are used
  for implementing the key functionalities of these mathematical operations.
  
  Different libraries use different representations and encoding of the
  image computed. Details can be found in the respective sections of the
  typical FFT libraries:
  
  * `FFTW by M. Frigo and S. G. Johnson <https://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Tutorial.html#Tutorial>`_
  * `Intel MKL by the Intel Co. <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/onemkl/developer-reference-c/2023-0/fourier-transform-functions.html>`_
  * `cuFFT by the NVidia Co. <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cufft/index.html>`_
  
  Users are strongly advised to inspect carefully which specific conventions
  their library uses to be able to store and or modify the implementation
  of their code so that the serialized representations as it is detailed
  here for NeXus matches with their intention.
