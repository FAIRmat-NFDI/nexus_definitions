  Base class to describe specific analysis methods in electron microscopy.
  
  This base class represent a template how specialized, deep, and
  method-specific base classes can be defined with which an (NXem) application
  definition gets equipped with specific groups to document
  method-specific process steps and analyzed quantities.
  The template base class name NXem_method needs to be changed for each
  method e.g. NXem_adf, NXem_ebsd, NXem_eels, NXem_eds, NXem_se, NXem_bse.
