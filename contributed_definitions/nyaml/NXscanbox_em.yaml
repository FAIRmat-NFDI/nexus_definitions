  Scan box and coils which deflect a beam of charged particles in a controlled manner.
  
  The scan box is instructed by an instance of :ref:`NXprogram`, some control software,
  which is not necessarily the same program as for all components of a microscope.
  
  The scanbox directs the probe of charged particles (electrons, ions)
  to controlled locations according to a scan scheme and plan.
  
  To achieve this task, the scanbox typically contains deflection coils,
  which should be modelled as instances of :ref:`NXdeflector`.
