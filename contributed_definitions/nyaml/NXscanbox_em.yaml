  Scan box and coils which deflect a beam of charged particles in a controlled manner.
  
  The scan box is instructed by an instance of :ref:`NXprogram`, some control software,
  which is not necessarily the same program as for all components of a microscope.
  
  The scanbox directs the probe of charged particles (electrons, ions)
  to controlled locations according to a scan scheme and plan.

  scan_schema(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Name of the typically tech-partner-specific term that specifies
      an automated protocol which controls the details how the components
      of the microscope work together to achieve a controlled scanning of the
      beam over the sample surface.
      
      In most cases users do not know, have to care, or are able to disentangle the
      details of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the components of the microscope.
      Instead, they rely on the assumption that the microscope and control software
      work as expected. Selecting then a specific scan_schema assures some level
      of reproducibility in the way how the beam is scanned over the surface.
