NXfit(NXobject):
  label:
    doc: |
      Human-readable label for this fit procedure.
  data(NXdata):
    doc: |
      Input data and results of the fit.
    input_dependent(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_ANY
      doc: |
        Independent axis for this fit procedure.
      dim: (n_points,)

        Dependent axis for this fit procedure.
      dim: (n_points,)
    envelope(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_ANY
      doc: |
        Resulting envelope of all NXpeak instances.
        Should have the same dimension as the `position` axes of the individual peaks.

    residual(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_ANY
      doc: |
        Difference between the envelope and the data to be fitted.
      dim: (n_points,)
  peak_PEAK(NXpeak):
    doc: |
      One spectral peak of the peak model.
      It is envisioned that peaks are labeled as peak_0, peak_1, and so on.
    total_area(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_ANY
      doc: |
        Total area under the curve (can also be used for the total area minus any
        background values).
    relative_sensitivity_factor(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_UNITLESS
      doc: |
        Relative sensitivity for this peak, to be used for quantification in
        an NXprocess.
        
        As an example, in X-ray spectroscopy could depend on the energy scale
        (see position), the ionization cross section, and the element probed.
    relative_area(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_ANY
      doc: |
        Relative area of this peak compared to other peaks.
        
        The relative area can simply be derived by dividing the total_area by the
        total area of all peaks or by a more complicated method (e.g., by
        additionally dividing by the relative sensitivity factors). Details shall
        be given in fitting_method.
  background_BACKGROUND(NXfit_background):
    doc: |
      One fitted background (functional, position, and intensities) of the peak fit.
      It is envisioned that peaks are labeled as background_0, background_1, and
      so on.

    doc: |
      Function used to optimize the parameters during peak fitting.
    description:
      doc: |
        Description of the method used to optimize the parameters during peak fitting.
        Examples:
        - least squares
        - non-linear least squares
        - Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (damped least-squares)

  figure_of_merit_METRIC(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
    doc: |
      Figure-of-merit to determine the goodness of fit, i.e., how well the peak model
      fits the measured observations.
      
      This value (which is a single number) is oftenused to guide adjustments to the
      fitting parameters in the peak fitting process.
    \@metric:
      doc: |
        Metric used to determine the goodness of fit. Examples include:
        - :math:`\Chi^2`, the standard deviation of the residuals
        - reduced :math:`\Chi^2`:, :math:`\Chi^2`: per degree of freedom
        - :math:`R^2`, the coefficient of determination
