  Base classes definition for lock in devices.
category: base
NXlockin:
  hardware(NXfabrication):
    doc: Hardware manufacturers and type of lockin amplifier.
  (NXamplifier):
    doc: By mixing the input signal (STS signal) with the modulated signal (such as Bias) and comparing it with the reference signal, they are enhanced and the effects of noise interference are reduced, resulting in more accurate measurements.
  bias_divider:
    doc: if Lock-in -- Bias Divider 1/10 or 1/100 # if the modulation
  modulation_status(NX_BOOLEAN):
    doc: Switch the lock-in moulation on or off.
  modulation_signal:
    doc: A modulation signal (such as bias, current et.al.) is a periodic voltage signal, usually applied to the surface of a sample, which serves to modify the physical properties of the sample surface and generate weak AC current signals that can be detected and analysed by instruments such as lock-in amplifiers. 
  modulation_amplitude(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Sets the amplitude (in physical units of the modulated signal) of the sine modulation.
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE (For bais modulate signal, it depands on the modulate type)
  modulation_frequency(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Sets the frequency of the sine modulation added to the signal to modulate.
    unit: NX_FREQUENCY
  demodulated_signal:
    doc: The input signal (STS signal) will be demodulated, in order to determine the amplitude and phase at the frequency set in the Frequency field or harmonics, such as current, bias, et.al.
  #output (demodulated signal) characterisation (foreach channel, like demodulation, a separate sensor output, e.g. X,Y)
  number_of_demodulator_channels(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: The number of signals which will be demodulated.
  low_pass(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Order and cut-off frequency of the low-pass filter applied on the demodulated signals (X,Y). Cut-off frq (low pass filter) (foreach DemodulatorChannels)
    unit: NX_FREQUENCY
  hi_pass(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Order and cut-off frequency of the high-pass filter applied on the demodulation signal. Cut-off frq (hi pass filter) (foreach DemodulatorChannels)
    unit: NX_FREQUENCY
  lp_filter_cutoff(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Sets the cut-off frequency of the low-pass filter (affects the displayed TC (s) value) for D1. The filter is applied to the demodulated signals (X,Y).
    unit: NX_FREQUENCY
  lp_filter_order(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Order and cut-off frequency of the low-pass filter applied on the demodulated signals (X,Y). Reducing the bandwidth or increasing the order reduces noise on the demodulated signals, but will require longer settling and measurement times.
  hp_filter_cutoff(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Sets the cut-off frequency of the high-pass filter (affects the displayed TC (s) value) for D1. The filter is applied to the demodulated signals (X,Y).
    unit: NX_FREQUENCY
  hp_filter_order(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Order and cut-off frequency of the high-pass filter applied on the demodulation signal of D!. This is used mainly to suppress a DC component of the demodulation signal, which would lead to a component at modulation frequency in the demodulated signals.
  sync(NX_BOOLEAN):
    doc: Switch on/off the Sync filter on the demodulated signals (X,Y) on or off.  (foreach DemodulatorChannels)
  ref_phase(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Reference phase for the sine on the demodulated signal with respect to the modulation signal. (foreach DemodulatorChannels)
    unit: NX_FREQUENCY
  integration_time(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Time during which the data are acquired and averaged. (for the input filter)
    unit: NX_TIME
  order_of_harmonics(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: The order of the harmonic oscillation to detect on the demodulated signals. (with respect to the modulation frequency)
  sensitivity_factor(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Ratio of output signal amplitude to input signal amplitue (V/V). (input gain) # Not sure about it.
