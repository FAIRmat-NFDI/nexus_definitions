  Base classes definition for lock in devices.
category: base
NXlockin:
  hardware(NXfabrication):
    doc: Hardware manufacturers and type of lockin amplifier.
  (NXamplifier):
    doc: input and output amplifiers
  Lock-in stats(NX_BOOLEAN):
    doc: Switch the lock-in moulation on or off.
  Modulate signal(NX_CHAR):
    doc: This is the signal on which the modulation (sine) will be added, such as current, bias, et.al.
  Amplitude(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Sets the amplitude (in physical units of the modulated signal) of the sine modulation.
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE (For bais modulate signal, it depands on the modulate type)
  frequency(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Sets the frequency of the sine modulation added to the signal to modulate. 
    unit: NX_FREQUENCY
  Demodulated signal(NX_CHAR): 
    doc: This is the signal which will be demodulated, in order to determine the amplitude and phase at the frequency set in the Frequency field or harmonics, such as current, bias, et.al.
  #output (demodulated signal) characterisation (foreach channel, like demodulation, a separate sensor output, e.g. X,Y)
  NumOfDemodulatorChannels(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: The number of signals which will be demodulated.
  LowPass(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Order and cut-off frequency of the low-pass filter applied on the demodulated signals (X,Y). Cut-off frq (low pass filter) (foreach DemodulatorChannels)
    unit: NX_FREQUENCY
  HiPass(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Order and cut-off frequency of the high-pass filter applied on the demodulation signal. Cut-off frq (hi pass filter) (foreach DemodulatorChannels)
    unit: NX_FREQUENCY
  LP Filter Cutoff(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Sets the cut-off frequency of the low-pass filter (affects the displayed TC (s) value) for D1. The filter is applied to the demodulated signals (X,Y).
    unit: NX_FREQUENCY
  LP Filter Order(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Order and cut-off frequency of the low-pass filter applied on the demodulated signals (X,Y). Reducing the bandwidth or increasing the order reduces noise on the demodulated signals, but will require longer settling and measurement times.
  HP Filter Cutoff(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Sets the cut-off frequency of the high-pass filter (affects the displayed TC (s) value) for D1. The filter is applied to the demodulated signals (X,Y).
    unit: NX_FREQUENCY
  HP Filter Order(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Order and cut-off frequency of the high-pass filter applied on the demodulation signal of D!. This is used mainly to suppress a DC component of the demodulation signal, which would lead to a component at modulation frequency in the demodulated signals.
  Sync(NX_BOOLEAN):
    doc: Switch on/off the Sync filter on the demodulated signals (X,Y) on or off.  (foreach DemodulatorChannels)
  refPhase(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Reference phase for the sine on the demodulated signal with respect to the modulation signal. (foreach DemodulatorChannels)
    unit: NX_FREQUENCY
  integrationTime(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Time during which the data are acquired and averaged. (for the input filter)
    unit: NX_TIME
  OrderOfHarmonics(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: The order of the harmonic oscillation to detect on the demodulated signals. (with respect to the modulation frequency)
  sensitivityFactor(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Ratio of output signal amplitude to input signal amplitue (V/V). (input gain) # Not sure about it.
