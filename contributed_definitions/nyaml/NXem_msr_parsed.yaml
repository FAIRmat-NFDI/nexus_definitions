  Base class for collecting data during a session at a real electron microscope.
  
  For collecting data and experiments which are simulations of an
  electron microscope use the NXem_sim base class.

      (Meta)data of the microscope and the lab in which it stands.
      
      This em_lab group differs from potential em_lab groups inside
      NXevent_data_em instances in that here the more static descriptions
      are kept and changes or time-dependent, i.e. dynamics are logged
      via those the em_lab group inside instances of NXevent_data_em.
      
      For an NXevent_data_em instance users should store only those settings for a
      component which are relevant to understand the current state of the component.
      Here, current means at the point in time, i.e. the time interval,
      which the event represents.
      
      For example it is not relevant to store in each NXevent_data_em
      electron_source group again the details of the gun type and manufacturer
      but only the high-voltage value if it was different for that event.
      
      As such the em_lab group here is evaluated first.

        Given name of the microscope at the hosting institution.
        This is an alias. Examples could be NionHermes, Titan, JEOL,
        Gemini, etc.

      doc: |
        Location of the lab or place where the instrument is installed.
        Using GEOREF is preferred.

        Description of the type of the detector.
        
        Electron microscopes have typically multiple detectors.
        Different technologies are in use like CCD, scintillator,
        direct electron, CMOS, or image plate to name but a few.
