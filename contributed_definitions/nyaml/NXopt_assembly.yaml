  Contains datastructures of an experimental optical setup (i.e., multiple transfermatrix tables).
  These datastructures are used to relate physical properties of two beams

  (NXopt_beam) which have one common optical element (NXopt_element) (one 
  specific transfermatrix).
  One of these beams in an input beam and the other one is an output beam.

  The data describes the change of beam properties, e.g. the intensity of a beam is reduced because the transmission coefficient of the opt element is lower than 1.

    Variables used throughout the document, e.g. dimensions or parameters.
  N_variables: |
    Length of the array associated to the data type.
opt_assembly(NXobject): # Which properties of NXdata are required?
  datatype_N:
    doc: |
      Select which type of data was recorded, for example aperture and
      focal length.
      It is possible to have multiple selections. This selection defines
      how many columns (N_variables) are stored in the data array.
      N in the name, is the index number in which order the given
      property is listed. 
    enumeration:
      [
        aperture,
        focallength,
        orientation,
        jones matrix,
      ]
  matrix_elements:
    doc: |
      Please list in this array the column and row names used in your actual data.
      That is in the case of aperture ['diameter'] or focal length ['focal_length_value']
      and for orientation ['OM1', 'OM2', 'OM3'] or for jones matrix
      ['JM1','JM2']

  TRANSFERMATRIXTABLE(NXtransfer_matrix_table):
    doc: |
      Contains the datastructure which relates beam properties of an 

      input and output beam as result of the input beam interaction
      with the optical element.
