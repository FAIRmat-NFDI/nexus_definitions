      via the service offered as described in identifier_type.

      How can the identifier be resolved?

      The identifier zero is reserved for the special unknown ion type.

  isotope_vector(NX_UINT):
    doc: |
      A vector of isotope hash values. These values have to be stored in an array,
      sorted in decreasing order. The array is filled with zero hash values
      indicating unused places. The individual hash values are built with the
      following hash function:
      
      The hash value :math:`H` is :math:`H = Z + N*256` with :math:`Z`
      the number of protons and :math:`N` the number of neutrons
      of each isotope respectively.
      
      Z and N have to be 8-bit unsigned integers.
      For the rationale behind this `M. KÃ¼hbach et al. (2021) <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927621012241>`_

  nuclid_list(NX_UINT):
    doc: |
      A supplementary row vector which decodes the isotope_vector into
      a human-readable matrix of nuclids with the following formatting:
      
      The first row specifies the isotope mass number, i.e. using the hashvalues
      from the isotope_vector this is :math:`Z + N`. As an example for a
      carbon-14 isotope the number is 14.
      The second row specifies the number of protons :math:`Z`, e.g. 6 for the
      carbon-14 example. This row matrix is thus mapping the notation of
      using superscribed isotope mass and subscripted number of protons
      to identify isotopes.
      Unused places filling up to n_ivecmax need to be filled with zero.

  color(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Color code used for visualizing such ions.
  volume(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Assumed volume of the ion.
      
      In atom probe microscopy this field can be used to store the reconstructed
      volume per ion (average) which is typically stored in range files and will
      be used when building a tomographic reconstruction of an atom probe
      dataset.
    unit: NX_VOLUME
  charge(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Charge of the ion.
    unit: NX_CHARGE
  charge_state(NX_INT):
    doc: |
      Signed charge state of the ion in multiples of electron charge.
      
      Only positive values will be measured in atom probe microscopy as the
      ions are accelerated by a negatively signed bias electric field.
      In the case that the charge state is not explicitly recoverable,
      the value should be set to zero.
      
      In atom probe microscopy this is for example the case when using
      classical range file formats like RNG, RRNG for atom probe data.
      These file formats do not document the charge state explicitly.
      They report the number of atoms of each element per molecular ion
      surplus the mass-to-charge-state-ratio interval.
      With this information it is possible to recover the charge state only
      for specific molecular ions as the accumulated mass of the molecular ion
      is defined by the isotopes, which without knowing the charge, leads
      to an underconstrained problem.
      Details on ranging can be found in the literature: `M. K. Miller <https://doi.org/10.1002/sia.1719>`_

  name(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Human-readable ion type name (e.g. Al +++)
      The string should consists of UTF-8 characters, ideally using LaTeX
      notation to specify the isotopes, ions, and charge state.
      Examples are 12C + or Al +++.
      
      To ease automated parsing isotope_vector should be the
      preferred machine-readable information used.
  mass_to_charge_range(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Associated lower (mqmin) and upper (mqmax) bounds of the
      mass-to-charge-state ratio interval(s) [mqmin, mqmax]
      (boundaries inclusive). This field is primarily of interest
      for documenting :ref:`NXprocess` steps of indexing a ToF/mass-to-charge
      state histogram.
