      Granularizing at the socket level.
      
      Typical examples follow: A desktop computer with a single GPU one
      could describe using one instance of NXcs_gpu_obj inside one instance of
      NXcs_gpu_sys.
      A desktop computer with two GPUs one could describe using two instances
      of NXcs_gpu_obj inside one instance of NXcs_gpu_sys.
      A GPU server like nowadays used for artificial intelligence
      one could describe as a system with n instances of NXcs_gpu_obj
      in one NXcs_gpu_sys or NXcs_cpu_sys.
