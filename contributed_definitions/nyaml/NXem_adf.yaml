  Base class method-specific for annular dark field imaging.
  
  In the majority of cases simple d-dimensional regular scan patterns are used
  to probe a region-of-interest (ROI). Examples can be single point aka spot
  measurements, line profiles, or (rectangular) surface mappings.
  The latter pattern is the most frequently used.
  
  For now the base class provides for scans for which the settings,
  binning, and energy resolution is the same for each scan point.
