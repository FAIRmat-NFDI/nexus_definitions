  Base classes definition for bias devices.
category: base
NXbias(NXobject):
  bias(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Applied a voltage between tip and sample.
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE
  tunneling resistor(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: The ratio between the tunneling current at the sample surface and the bias voltage applied between between the sample and the tip.
    unit: NX_ANY (No NX_resistance)
  Calibration(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Calibration of the Bias output (V/V).
  offset(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Allows compensating for an offset in Bias. Hardware parameter offset.
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE
  Modulated signal Bias(NX_NUMBER): # or transfer it to NXlockin?
    doc: Sets the amplitude (in physical units of the modulated signal) of the sine modulation.
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE
  (Bias Spectroscopy): 
    doc: Bias sweeps while measuring arbitrary channels with I(V) curves.
  Channels(NX_CHAR):
    doc: Select the channels to record.
  Reset Bias(NX_BOOLEAN):
    doc: |
     When selected, the Bias voltage returns to the initial value (before starting the sweep) at the end of the spectroscopy measurement (default). When not selected, Bias remains at the last value of the sweep. This is useful e.g. when combining several sweep segments. Example for an automated measurement (using Programming Interface): switch off Z-Controller, start spectroscopy sweep segments (only fwd sweep, no reset bias), set bias back to initial value, switch on Z-Controller.
  Record final Z(NX_BOOLEAN):
    doc: Select whether to record the Z position during Z averaging time at the end of the sweep (after Z control time) and store the average value in the header of the file when saving. Using this option increases the sweep time by Z averaging time.
  Lock-In run(NX_BOOLEAN):
    doc: Select whether to set the Lock-In to run during the measurement. When using this feature, make sure the Lock-In is configured correctly and settling times are set to twice the Lock-In period at least. This option is ignored when Lock-In is already running. This option is disabled if the Sweep Mode is MLS and the flag to configure the Lock-In per segment in the Multiline segment editor is set.
  Integration time(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Time during which the spectroscopy data are acquired and averaged.
    unit: NX_TIME
  Number of sweeps(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Number of sweeps to measure and average.
  Sweep Start(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: The first bias values of the sweep.
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE
  Sweep End(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: The last bias values of the sweep.
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE
  Num Pixel(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Define the sweep number of points, that is, the maximum spectrum resolution eq. Bias window divide by Num Pixel.
  Z Avg time(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Duration over which the Z position is recorded and averaged before and after the sweep (the latter only if Record final Z position is selected in the Advanced section). After the initial Z averaging time, if Z-Controller to Hold is selected in the Advanced section, the Z-Controller is set to hold and the tip is placed at the previously averaged Z position (plus Z offset).
    unit: NX_TIME
  SW Filter type (NX_CHAR): 
    doc: Select a filter to smooth the displayed data. When saving, if any filter selected, filtered data are saved to file along with the unfiltered data.
  SW Filter Order(NX_NUMBER): 
    doc: Filter order of a dynamic filter or width (in number of points) for the gaussian filter.
  SW Filter Cutoff frq(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Cutoff frequency for dynamic filters.
  Z offset(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Offset added to the initial averaged position Zaver before starting to sweep. This parameter is disabled when Z-Controller to Hold is deselected in the Advanced section. The LED “Alt” next to the Z offset indicates if an alternate Z-controller setpoint is enabled.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
  Settling time(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: time to wait after changing the bias to the next level and before starting to acquire data.
    unit: NX_TIME
  End Settling time(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Time to wait after the sweep has finished and the bias is ramped to the initial value.
    unit: NX_TIME
  Z control time(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Time during which the Z-Controller is enabled once a sweep has finished. When averaging multiple sweeps (i.e. Sweeps>1), the Z-Controller is enabled for this duration between each sweep. After the last sweep, it will wait the specified time before continuing a running scan. This ensures each sweep reliably starts from the same position. This parameter is disabled when Z-Controller to Hold is deselected in the Advanced section.
    unit: NX_TIME
  Max Slew rate(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Maximum rate at which the bias changes (before, during and after sweeping). (V/s)
  backward sweep(NX_BOOLEAN):
    doc: Select whether to measure the backward (return) sweep or the forward only.
  Z-controller hold(NX_BOOLEAN):
    doc: Select whether to set the Z-Controller on hold (i.e. disabled) during the sweep. It is selected by default. When deselected, Z-offset and Z control time parameters are disabled.
