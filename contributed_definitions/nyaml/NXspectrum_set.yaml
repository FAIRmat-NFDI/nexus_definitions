NXspectrum_set(NXobject):
  # for EELS we likely need a complex-valued NXspectrum_c_set to this
  # NXspectrum_set base class here which should then be splitted into an
  # NXspectrum_set to reduce redundant fields and specialized NXspectrum_r/c_set
  (NXprocess):
    doc: |
      Details how spectra were processed from the detector readings.

      doc: |
        Resolvable data artifact (e.g. filename) from which the all values in
        the :ref:`NXdata` instances in this :ref:`NXspectrum_set` were
        loaded during parsing.

        Imaging (data collection) mode of the instrument during acquisition
        of the data in this :ref:`NXspectrum_set` instance.

        Link or name of an :ref:`NXdetector` instance with which the data were collected.

  ##MK::feel free to contact us when you would like to include
  # lik omega/q mapping more complicated scan pattern than rectangular ones.
  stack(NXdata):
    doc: |
      Collected spectra for all pixels of a rectangular region-of-interest.
      
      This representation supports rectangular scan pattern with equidistant
      energy bins. For randomly or dissimilarly spaced scan points
      use collection instead.
