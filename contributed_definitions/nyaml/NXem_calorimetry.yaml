          List of comma-separated elements from the periodic table that are
          contained in the specimen. If the specimen substance has multiple

          `atom_types`.
          
          The purpose of the field is to offer research data management systems an
          opportunity to parse the relevant elements without having to interpret
          these from the resources pointed to by parent_identifier or walk through
          eventually deeply nested groups in data instances.
