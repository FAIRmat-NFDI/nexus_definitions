  Base class for reporting a set of images.
  
  This class provides a base vocabulary to be used for specialized :ref:`NXimage_set`
  base classes like :ref:`NXimage_r_set` and :ref:`NXimage_c_set`.
symbols:
  n_images: |
    Number of images in the stack.
  n_y: |
    Number of pixel per image in the slow direction.
  n_x: |
    Number of pixel per image in the fast direction.

NXimage_set(NXobject):
  (NXprocess):
    doc: |
      Details how NXdata instance inside instance of (specialized)
      :ref:`NXimage_set` were processed from the detector readings/raw data.
    source(NXserialized):
      doc: |
        Resolvable data artifact (e.g. filename) from which the all values in
        the :ref:`NXdata` instances in this :ref:`NXimage_set` were loaded
        during parsing.
        
        Possibility to document from which specific other serialized resource
        as the source pieces of information where processed when NeXus is used
        as a semantic file format to serialize that information differently.
        
        The group in combination with an added field *absolute_path* therein adds context.
    mode(NX_CHAR):
      doc: |
        Imaging (data collection) mode of the instrument during acquisition
        of the data in this :ref:`NXimage_set` instance.
    detector_identifier(NX_CHAR):
