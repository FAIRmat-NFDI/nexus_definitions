      Granularizing at the socket level.
      
      Typical examples follow: A desktop computer with a single CPU one
      could describe using one instance of NXcs_cpu_obj inside one instance of
      NXcs_cpu_sys.
      A dual-socket server one could describe using two instances of NXcs_cpu_obj
      inside one instance of NXcs_cpu_sys.
      A server with two dual-socket server nodes one could describe
      with the above group of one NXcs_cpu_sys into another NXcs_cpu_sys.
