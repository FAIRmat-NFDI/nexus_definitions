  Application definition for temperature-dependent IV curve measurements, #CAP with a focus on bias spectroscopy in scanning tunneling microscopy.

  In this application definition, times should be specified always together
  with an UTC offset.

  This is the application definition describing temperature (T) dependent current voltage (IV) curve
  measurements. For this a temperature is set. After reaching the temperature,
  a voltage sweep is performed. For each voltage a current is measured.
  Then, the next desired temperature is set and an IV measurement is performed.
  #CAP the X, Y, Z, position of the probes or tip can be defined. #CAP The data can be visualized in a tensor with:
  I (NXsensor_C, NXsoftware_Read_offset, NXcircuit)
  parameters:
  V has (NXsource+offset, NXsoftware_Scan_offset, NXsensor_V, NXcircuit)
  T has (NXsource, NXsoftware_Scan_offset, NXsensor_T)
  x has (NXsoftware_Scan_offset)
  y has (NXsoftware_Scan_offset)

This parameter is disabled when Z-Controller to Hold is deselected in the Advanced section. The LED “Alt” next to the Z offset indicates if an alternate Z-controller setpoint is enabled.
        Settling time(NXbias) (s) (e.g. 2.1E-3) # Time to wait after changing the bias to the next level and before starting to acquire data. Adjust this parameter to avoid transient effect induced by the bias change. Integration time: time during which the data are acquired and averaged.
        Z-Ctrl hold(NXpositioner) (e.g. TRUE) # When selected, the Z-Controller is set to hold during the pulse. This means that the controller doesn't control the Z position during the pulse.

        Bias Spectroscopy>Z control time(NXbias) (s) (e.g.200E-3) # Time during which the Z-Controller is enabled once a sweep has finished. When averaging multiple sweeps (i.e. Sweeps>1), the Z-Controller is enabled for this duration between each sweep. After the last sweep, it will wait the specified time before continuing a running scan. This ensures each sweep reliably starts from the same position. This parameter is disabled when Z-Controller to Hold is deselected in the Advanced section.

The formula for the controller in the frequency domain is: G(s) = P + I/s = P(1 + 1/(Ts)). The integral gain and time constant are related as follows: I = P/T.

        Z-Controller>TipLift(NXpositioner) (m) (e.g.0E+0) # Lifts the tip by the specified amount when then controller is switched off. This can be a positive or a negative number, i.e. the tip can also be moved towards the sample. Be careful with sign and value when using this feature.
        Z-Controller>Switch off delay(NXpositioner) (s) (e.g.0E+0) # Use this parameter for a reproducible position when switching off the Z-controller. When >0 and the Z-controller is switched off, it doesn't switch off immediately but continues to run for the specified time and averages the Z position.
