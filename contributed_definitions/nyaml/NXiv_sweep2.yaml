  Application definition for temperature-dependent IV curve measurements, #CAP with a focus on bias spectroscopy in scanning tunneling microscopy.

  In this application definition, times should be specified always together
  with an UTC offset.

  This is the application definition describing temperature (T) dependent current voltage (IV) curve
  measurements. For this a temperature is set. After reaching the temperature,
  a voltage sweep is performed. For each voltage a current is measured.
  Then, the next desired temperature is set and an IV measurement is performed.
  #CAP the X, Y, Z, position of the probes or tip can be defined. #CAP The data can be visualized in a tensor with:
  I (NXsensor_C, NXsoftware_Read_offset, NXcircuit)
  parameters:
  V has (NXsource+offset, NXsoftware_Scan_offset, NXsensor_V, NXcircuit)
  T has (NXsource, NXsoftware_Scan_offset, NXsensor_T)
  x has (NXsoftware_Scan_offset)
  y has (NXsoftware_Scan_offset)

For normal use, 300-500 ms is a good value, but for recording a resonance of a high-Q cantilever, values of several seconds might be necessary. Usually this parameter doesn’t need to be set from this module; the sweep modules will set this value according to the sweep timings.
