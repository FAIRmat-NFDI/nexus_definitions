            the surface leaf normal vector points in the positive z-direction.
            The value of this field is the angle between the
            analyzer optical axis and the leaf normal.
            If you only want to collect the angle between the leaf normal
            and the analyzer optical axis the `depends_on` attribute may be omitted.
            If a transformation chain is provided (with the `depends_on` attribute)
            it should depend on the analyzer optical axis or the jet direction depending
            on the use case.
