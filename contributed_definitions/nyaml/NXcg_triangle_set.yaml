  Computational geometry description of a set of triangles.
symbols:
  doc: |
    The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  d: |
    The dimensionality, which has to be at least 2.
  c: |
    The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of triangles.
  n_unique: |
    The number of unique vertices supporting the triangles.
type: group
NXcg_triangle_set(NXcg_primitive_set):
  number_of_unique_vertices(NX_INT):
    doc: |
      Number of unique vertices in the triangle set.
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
  (NXcg_face_list_data_structure):
    doc: |
      A simple approach to describe the entire set of triangles when the
      main intention is to store the shape of the triangles for
      visualization purposes.
      
      This description resembles the typical representation of primitives
      in file formats such as OFF, PLY, VTK, or STL.
  (NXcg_half_edge_data_structure):
    doc: |
      A graph-based approach to describe the entire set of triangles that
      is better suited for topological analyses than a face_list_data_structure.
  # properties of triangles
  edge_length(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Length of the edges of each triangle.
      
      For each triangle values are reported via traversing
      the vertices in the sequence as these are defined.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    dim: (c, 3)
  interior_angle(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Interior angles of each triangle.
      
      For each triangle values are reported for the angle opposite
      to the respective edges in the sequence how vertices are defined.
    unit: NX_ANGLE
    dim: (c, 3)
  bounding_box(NXcg_hexahedron_set):
    doc: |
      Axis-aligned or (approximate) (optimal) bounding boxes to each polygon.
