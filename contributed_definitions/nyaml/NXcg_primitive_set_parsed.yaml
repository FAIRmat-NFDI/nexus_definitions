  Computational geometry description of a set of primitives in Euclidean space.
info: |
  Primitives must not be degenerated or self-intersect.
  Properties of members in the set may differ. This base class defines
  common fields and properties of geometric primitives which simplify the
  definition of more complex primitives.
  More complex primitive sets like NXcg_cylinder_set are considered
  specializations of NXcg_primitive_set. They can contain
  all fields and groups which NXcg_primitive_set defines.
  This is an action of compositing an information set.
# many properties of non-degenerate primitives are in the number set R+ instead of in R+0
symbols:
  doc: |
    The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  d: |
    The dimensionality of the space.
  c: |
    The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of members.

  identifier_offset(Z):
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
    doc: |
      Integer which specifies the first index to be used for
      distinguishing identifiers of set members.
    info: |
      Identifiers can be defined either implicitly or explicitly.
      For implicit indexing identifiers are defined on the interval
      [identifier_offset, identifier_offset+c-1].
      For explicit indexing the field identifier to be defined.
      The identifier_offset field can be used for example to communicate if
      identifiers are expected to start from 1, which is commonly referred to
      as Fortran-/Matlab-indexing, or from 0, which is commonly referred to
      as C-, Python-style indexing, respectively.

    doc: |
      Identifier of each member for explicit indexing.

    doc: |
      Qualifier for primitive individually how one edge is longer than all

      associated with one edge being parallel to an axis of
      the coordinate system.

      are interpretable.
