  Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) is a branch of microscopy to study the surface of
  materials at the Atomic level. The technique is mainly motivated from the quantum 
  tunneling effect theory though a few of it successor techniques such AFM uses 
  electrostatic forces or atomic forces to study the surface of the materials.

  This base class mainly is designed as a sckeleton or contains common concepts for 
  other SPM sub-techniques such as STM, STS, AFM, etc.

  (NXentry):
    definition: 
      doc:
        Name of the definition that is used for the application.
      enumeration:
        - NXspm
    entry_identifier:
      doc:
        The unique identifier for the entry. The identifier is mainly lab-defined 
        and can be a combination of the sample name, date and time,
        experiment condition (such as temperature) or instrument-generated
        unique identifier.
    collection_identifier:
      exists: optional
      doc:
        The unique identifier for the collection. The identifier is used to
        group a number of the experiments run upon the same setup and/or same sample.
    experiment_identifier:
      doc:
        The unique identifier for the experiment. The identifier is used to distinguish
        an experiment from the other experiments grouped in the same collection.
    (NXinstrument):
      doc:
        The instrument information.
      hardware(NXfabrication):
        exists: optional
        doc:
          The hardware description of the core instrument setup of the experiment.
          Usually, the entire instrument is supplied by a single manufacturer. 

          To describe the hardware from any sub-components, use the hardware group that
          sub-component (child group of the NXinstrument group) group.
      software(NXfabrication):
        exists: optional
        doc:
          The software description of the core instrument setup of the experiment.
          Usually, the entire instrument is supplied by a single name/manufacturer/model/etc.

          To describe the software from any sub-components, use the software group under that instrument.
