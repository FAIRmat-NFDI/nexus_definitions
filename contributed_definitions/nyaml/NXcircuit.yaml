NXcircuit(NXobject):
  hardware(NX_FABRICATION):
    doc: Hardware type used in circuit, includes hardware manufacturers and type
  tunneling_current(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: The tunneling current between tip and sample after application of bias voltage.
    unit: NX_CURRENT
  calibration(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Calibration of the current measurement (A/V).
  offset(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Offset of the current measurement.
    unit: NX_CURRENT
  gain(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Proportional relationship between the probe output voltage and the actual tunneling current when measuring the tunneling current.
  channels(NX_CHAR):
    doc: The scan channels are selected by users (in scan contronaller).
  rt_frequency(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: The bandwitdh of the Hardware and/or Software
    unit: NX_FREQUENCY
  signals_oversampling(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: (Signals Periods) The Signals Period is the rate at which the signals are transferred to the host computer running the control software. This is usually lower by a factor of 10 than the sampling rate, because an internal oversampling of the signal is done on the real time engine. You can reduce the oversampling down to 1 in order to resolve higher frequencies in the Spectrum Analyzer.
    unit: NX_ANY
  acquisition_period(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Update rate for several processes like History Graph, Auto-Approach, and for many Programming Interface functions. This is usually set to 20 ms. All additional timings (7-9) can only be integer multiples of this value. They can be set to different values, but the actual timing value will be coerced to a multiple of the Acquisition Period.
    unit: NX_TIME
  animations_period(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Update rate of animated graphical indicators. These are e.g. some graphs & sliders. A reasonable value is 40 ms (25 updates per second). Increase this period to reduce the processor load for the graphical user interface, especially on slow computers. This value is purely a user interface update rate and does not affect measurements in any way.
    unit: NX_TIME
  indicators_period(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Update rate of digital indicators, e.g. the numbers displayed besides each slider. Here, 3 updates per second, or 300 ms is enough. This value is purely a user interface update rate and does not affect measurements in any way.
    unit: NX_TIME
  measurements_period(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: The Measurements period is the integration time for precise measurements (averaging over specified period), mostly used in sweep modules. Examples are recording of a force-distance curve or a resonance of a cantilever. For fast measurements with small steps, a value of 40 ms may be reasonable. For normal use, 300-500 ms is a good value, but for recording a resonance of a high-Q cantilever, values of several seconds might be necessary. Usually this parameter doesnâ€™t need to be set from this module; the sweep modules will set this value according to the sweep timings.
    unit: NX_TIME
  number_of_outputs(NX_INT):
    doc: Number of output channels
  output_mode(NX_CHAR):
    doc: The user output in each monitor mode.
  output_value(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: The values for each output channel.
    unit: NX_ANY
  output_name(NX_CHAR):
    doc: User outputs whose name can be modified in the corresponding module.
  output_slew_rate(NX_CHAR):
    doc: The rate at which the one of the signal changes when ramping to the starting point. (V/s)
