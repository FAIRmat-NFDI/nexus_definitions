#              (Signals Periods) The Signals Period is the rate at which the signals are
#              transferred to the host computer running the control software. This is usually
#              lower by a factor of 10 than the sampling rate, because an internal oversampling
#              of the signal is done on the real time engine. You can reduce the oversampling
#              down to 1 in order to resolve higher frequencies in the Spectrum Analyzer.

#              Update rate for several processes like History Graph, Auto-Approach, and for
#              many Programming Interface functions. This is usually set to 20 ms. All
#              additional timings (7-9) can only be integer multiples of this value. They can
#              be set to different values, but the actual timing value will be coerced to a

#              sliders. A reasonable value is 40 ms (25 updates per second). Increase this
#              period to reduce the processor load for the graphical user interface, especially
#              on slow computers. This value is purely a user interface update rate and does
#              not affect measurements in any way.

#     <field name="indicators_period" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_TIME">
#         <doc>
#              Update rate of digital indicators, e.g. the numbers displayed besides each
#              slider. Here, 3 updates per second, or 300 ms is enough. This value is purely a
#              user interface update rate and does not affect measurements in any way.

#     <field name="measurements_period" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_TIME">
#         <doc>
#              The Measurements period is the integration time for precise measurements
#              (averaging over specified period), mostly used in sweep modules. Examples are
#              recording of a force-distance curve or a resonance of a cantilever. For fast
#              measurements with small steps, a value of 40 ms may be reasonable. For normal
#              use, 300-500 ms is a good value, but for recording a resonance of a high-Q
#              cantilever, values of several seconds might be necessary. Usually this parameter
#              doesnâ€™t need to be set from this module; the sweep modules will set this value
#              according to the sweep timings.
