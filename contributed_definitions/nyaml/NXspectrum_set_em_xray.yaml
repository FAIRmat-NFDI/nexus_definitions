  Container for reporting a set of energy-dispersive X-ray spectra.
  
  Virtually the most important case is that spectra are collected in
  a scanning microscope (SEM or STEM) for a collection of points.
  The majority of cases use simple d-dimensional regular scan pattern,
  such as single point, line profiles, or (rectangular) surface mappings.
  The latter pattern is the most frequently used.
  
  For now the base class provides for scans for which the settings,
  binning, and energy resolution is the same for each scan point.
  
  `IUPAC instead of Siegbahn notation <https://doi.org/10.1002/xrs.1300200308>`_
  should be used.
