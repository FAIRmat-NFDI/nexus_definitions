  This is the application definition describing ellipsometry experiments.
  
  Such experiments may be as simple as identifying how a reflected
  beam of light with a single wavelength changes its polarization state,
  to a variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry experiment.
  
  The application definition specifies optical spectroscopy (NXopt), by extending
  the terms and setting specific requirements.

# 04/2024
# A rework of the draft version(06/2022) of a NeXus application definition for ellipsometry.
# 09/2024
# TODO (Workshop output):
# - Better categorization of ellipsoeter types:
# Seperate in spectral range and measurement types (In situ vs infrared?? This grouping does not make sense)
# Maybe make a given special field for "spectral_range" with units of eV or nm?
# - Add a StepScanAnalzer as measurement type (continous/rotating mode the other? Ask Chris)
# - Redefine more/higher requirements for Ellipsometry compared to NXoptical_spectroscopy: Especially incident angle and polarization.
# - Refinements for ellipsometer_type and add ellipsometer_method/mode:
# "~ please consider renaming "ellipsometer_type" to "ellipsometer_method" or "ellipsometer_mode". Motivation: "rotating_compensator" etc. are methods of ellipsometry measurements, and some ellipsometers support multiple methods (e.g. rotating compensator, nulling etc).
# ~ please consider to use the field "ellipsometer_type" for entries directly related to the core instrument, i.e. "imaging ellipsometer",  "standard ellipsometer" (or: "non-imaging ellipsometer"), maybe others such as "back-focal plane ellipsometer"  "
# - Add a clear predefined data structure, as initially proposed, but dont add any restrictions regarding dimensions
# Make ois maybe similar to NXdata_mpes. In this way, at all FAIR assignments of the data is possible. As well use this to guide the people, to let them know, where they have to save their data. Just use NXdata is too vague. Could be easing the threshold to get into NeXus.
