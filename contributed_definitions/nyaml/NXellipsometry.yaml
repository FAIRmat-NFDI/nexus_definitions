  doc: Variables used throughout the document, e.g. dimensions or parameters.
  N_spectrum: |
    Length of the spectrum array (e.g. wavelength or energy) of the measured
    data.
  N_sensors: |
    Number of sensors used to measure parameters that influence the sample,
    such as temperature or pressure.
  N_measurements: |
    Number of measurements (1st dimension of measured_data array). This is
    equal to the number of parameters scanned. For example, if the experiment
    was performed at three different temperatures and two different pressures
    N_measurements = 2*3 = 6.
  N_detection_angles: |
    Number of detection angles of the beam reflected or scattered off the
    sample.
  N_incident_angles: Number of angles of incidence of the incident beam.
  N_observables: |
    Number of observables that are saved in a measurement. e.g. one for
    intensity, reflectivity or transmittance, two for Psi and Delta etc. This
    is equal to the second dimension of the data array 'measured_data' and the
    number of column names.
  N_time: "Number of time points measured, the length of NXsample/time_points"

      This is the application definition describing ellipsometry experiments.

      Such experiments may be as simple as identifying how a reflected
      beam of light with a single wavelength changes its polarization state,
      to a variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry experiment.

      The application definition defines:

      * elements of the experimental instrument
      * calibration information if available
      * parameters used to tune the state of the sample
      * sample description
