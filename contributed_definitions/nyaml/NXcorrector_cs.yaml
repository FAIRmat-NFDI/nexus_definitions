  Corrector for aberrations in an electron microscope.
  
  Different technology partners use different naming schemes and models
  for quantifying the aberration coefficients.
  
  The corrector in an electron microscope is composed of multiple lenses and
  multipole stigmators with vendor-specific details which are often undisclosed.
