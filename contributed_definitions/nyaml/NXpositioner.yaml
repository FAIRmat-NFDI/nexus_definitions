      Declares which child group contains a path leading
      to a ':'ref':'`NXdata` group.
      
      It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
      to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
      See https':'//www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
      for a summary of the discussion.
  depends_on(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |       
      NeXus positions components by applying a set of translations and rotations
      to apply to the component starting from 0, 0, 0. The order of these operations
      is critical and forms what NeXus calls a dependency chain. The depends_on
      field defines the path to the top most operation of the dependency chain or the
      string "." if located in the origin. Usually these operations are stored in a
      NXtransformations group. But NeXus allows them to be stored anywhere.
      
      .. todo':'':'
        Add a definition for the reference point of a positioner.
  (NXtransformations):
    doc: |       
      This is the group recommended for holding the chain of translation
      and rotation operations necessary to position the component within
      the instrument. The dependency chain may however traverse similar groups in
      other component groups.
  
  Position(NXtransformation):
    doc: To clarify the frame laboratory frame. The scanning area in x, y, and z position in the frame.
    unit: NX_LENGTH  
#(Z_contronller):  
#   doc: |
#    This controllers task is to continuously adjust the Z position of the stm tip in order to keep the selected control signal as close as possible to the Set Point. Different control signals lead to different contronller beahvior.
  Z_offset(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Offset added to the initial averaged position Zaver before starting to swepp.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
  Tip_position_Z(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Indicate the tip position Z between tip and sample. The tip position can also be varied when the controller is not running.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
  Controller name(NX_CHAR):
    doc: Controller name. This name which will be displayed at places where you can select a controller.
  Setpoint(NX_NUMBER): 
    doc: Set Point is the desired value of the control signal. It can be set by editing the number or using the slider bar. Click the "Set" button above the input field to use the actual value as Set Point. The slider shows the Set Point as well as the current value.
    unit: NX_CUTTENT
  Setpoint unit(NX_CHAR):
    doc: The unit of setpoint during the scanning.
  P gain(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: The Type switches controller parameters between P/I (proportional gain/integral gain) and P/T (proportional gain/time constant). The formula for the controller in the frequency domain is G(s) =     P + I/s = P(1 + 1/(Ts)). The integral gain and time constant are related as follows I = P/T.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
  I gain(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: The Type switches controller parameters between P/I (proportional gain/integral gain) and P/T (proportional gain/time constant). The formula for the controller in the frequency domain is G(s) = P + I/s = P(1 + 1/(Ts)). The integral gain and time constant are related as follows I = P/T.
    unit: NX_ANY (NX_SPEED?)
  Time const(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: The Type switches controller parameters between P/I (proportional gain/integral gain) and P/T (proportional gain/time constant). The formula for the controller in the frequency domain is G(s) = P + I/s = P(1 + 1/(Ts)). The integral gain and time constant are related as follows I = P/T.
    unit: NX_TIME
  TipLift(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Lifts the tip by the specified amount when then controller is switched off. This can be a positive or a negative number, i.e. the tip can also be moved towards the sample. Be careful with sign and value when using this feature.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
  Switch off delay(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Use this parameter for a reproducible position when switching off the Z-controller. When >0 and the Z-controller is switched off, it doesn't switch off immediately but continues to run for the specified time and averages the Z position.
    unit: NX_TIME
  Z-controller hold(NX_BOOLEAN):
    doc: (In bias spectroscopy) Select whether to set the Z-Controller on hold (i.e. disabled) during the sweep. It is selected by default. When deselected, Z-offset and Z control time parameters are disabled.
  Final Z(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: The final z-position during the bias spectroscopy scan. The availability of values is related to the mode of scanning.
