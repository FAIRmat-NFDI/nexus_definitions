NXpositioner_spm(NXpositioner):
  z_controller(NXpid_controller):
    doc: |
      This controller's task is to continuously adjust the Z position of the STM/STS tip in order
      to keep the selected control signal as close as possible to the Set Point. Different control
      signals lead to different controller's behavior.
      
      The second PID feedback loop intends to position the tip in the Z direction.
      
      p_gain (proportional gain) from z_controller is the same as K_p value from PID controller.
      i_gain (integral gain) from z_controller is the same as K_i value from PID controller.
      setpoint from z_controller is the same as setpoint from PID controller.
    D_t(NX_NUMBER):
      nameType: specified
      unit: NX_TIME
      doc: |
        The derivative time constant of the derivative part of the PID controller. Proportional Derivative constant
        K_d can be expressed as K_d = gain / D_t.
    I_t(NX_NUMBER):
      nameType: specified
      unit: NX_TIME
      doc: |
        The integral time constant of the integral part of the PID controller. Proportional Integral constant
        K_i can be expressed as K_i = gain / I_t.
    z(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_LENGTH
      doc: |
        To indicate the relative tip position z between tip and sample. The tip position
        can also be varied when the z_controller is not running.
    set_point(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_ANY
      doc: |
        The set point for the z-controller to be fixed and the target value could be
        height or current.
    controller_status(NX_BOOLEAN):
      exists: recommended
      doc: |
        The status of the controller to say was PID has been used or not.
    tip_lift(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_LENGTH
      doc: |
        If the tip is lifted from the stable point.
    switch_off_delay(NX_CHAR_OR_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_TIME
      doc: |
        The switch-off delay of the controller from its stable point.
  z_offset(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    doc: |
      Offset added to the initial averaged position tip on Z-axis before starting to
      scan.
  controller_label(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Controller label. This label which will be displayed at places where you can select a
      controller. Such label may also interpret from type of the signal used for feedback loop.
