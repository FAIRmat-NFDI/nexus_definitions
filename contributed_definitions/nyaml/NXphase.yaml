  Base class to describe a (thermodynamic) phase as a component of a material.
  
  Instances of phases can be crystalline.

      Identifier for each phase.
      
      The value 0 is reserved for the unknown phase that represents the
      null-model (no sufficiently significant information available).
      In other words, the phase_name is n/a aka notIndexed.
      
      The identifier_phase value should match with the integer suffix of the
      group name which represents that instance in a NeXus/HDF5 file, i.e.
      if three phases were used e.g. 0, 1, and 2, three instances of
      :ref:`NXphase` named phase0, phase1, and phase2 should be stored
      in that HDF5 file.
  name(NX_CHAR):

      Given name as an alias for identifying this phase.
      
      If the identifier_phase is 0 and one would like to use
      the field name, the value should be n/a or notIndexed.
