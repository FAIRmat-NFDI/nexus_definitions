  # probe_current and beam_current are related but not the same
  # the probe_current is equal to the beam_current only right at the surface where the beam enters the specimen
  # inserting a Faraday cup in the beam path measures the beam_current (along a specific location on the beam
  # before it enters the specimen but it is often assumed for the practical reason that measuring right at the surface
  # that the beam current is the probe current.
