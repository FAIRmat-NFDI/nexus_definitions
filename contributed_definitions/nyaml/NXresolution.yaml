  Describes the resolution of a physical quantity.
type: group
NXresolution(NXobject):
  physical_quantity:
    unit: NX_ANY
    doc: |
      The physical quantity of the resolution, e.g.,
      energy, momentum, time, etc.
  type:
    doc: |
      The process by which the resolution was determined.
    enumeration: [estimated, derived, calibrated, other]
  note(NXnote):
    doc: |
      Additional details of the estimate or description of the calibration procedure
  resolution(NX_FLOAT):
    unit: NX_ANY
    doc: |
      The resolution of the physical quantity.
  response_function(NXdata):
    doc: |
      The response of the instrument or part to a infinitesimal short input signal
      along the physical quantity of this group.
      This is also sometimes called instrument response function for time resolution or
      point spread function for spatial response.
      The resolution is typically determined by taking the FWHM of the response function.
    input(NX_FLOAT):
      unit: NX_ANY
      doc: |
        The input axis or grid of the response function.
        The unit should match the one of the resolution field.
    magnitude(NX_FLOAT):
      doc: |
        The magnitude of the response function corresponding to the points
        in the input axis or grid.
        This field should have the same dimensions as `input`.
  formula_symbol_LINK(NXlink):
    doc: |
      A symbol linking to another path in this appdef
      to be referred to from the `resolution_formula` field.
    symbol:
      exists: optional
    path:
      exists: optional
  resolution_formula:
    doc: |
      A resolution formula to determine the resolution from a set of symbols as
      entered by the `formula_symbol_...` fields.
      The output unit should match the provided unit of this field.
  (NXcalibration):
    doc: |
      For storing details and data of a calibration to derive a resolution from data
