  Metadata to ranging definitions made for a dataset in atom probe microscopy.
  
  Ranging is the process of labeling time-of-flight data with so-called iontypes
  which ideally specify the most likely ion/molecular ion evaporated within a
  given mass-to-charge-state-ratio value interval.
  
  The paraprobe-toolbox uses the convention that the so-called UNKNOWNTYPE
  iontype (or unranged ions) represents the default iontype.
  The ID of this special iontype is always reserved as 0. Each ion
  is assigned to the UNKNOWNTYPE by default. Iontypes are assigned
  by checking if the mass-to-charge-state-ratio values of an ion matches
  to any of the defined mass-to-charge-state-ratio intervals.

NXapm_input_ranging(NXobject):
  filename:
    doc: |
      Path and name of the NeXus/HDF5 file which stores ranging definitions.
    \@version:
      doc: |
        Version identifier of the file (representing an at least SHA256 strong)
        hash. Such hashes serve reproducibility as they can be used for tracking
        provenance metadata in a workflow.
  group_name_iontypes:
    doc: |
      Name of the group (prefix to the individual ranging definitions) inside
      the file referred to by filename which points to the specific ranging
      definition to use.
      An HDF5 file can store multiple ranging definitions. Using an ID is
      the mechanism to distinguish which specific ranging (version) will
      be processed. Reconstruction and ranging IDs can differ.
      They specify different IDs.
