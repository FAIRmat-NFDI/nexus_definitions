      .. index':'':' plotting

      Declares which child group contains a path leading
      to a ':'ref':'`NXdata` group.

      It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
      to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
      See https':'//www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
      for a summary of the discussion.
  depends_on(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      NeXus positions components by applying a set of translations and rotations
      to apply to the component starting from 0, 0, 0. The order of these operations
      is critical and forms what NeXus calls a dependency chain. The depends_on
      field defines the path to the top most operation of the dependency chain or the
      string "." if located in the origin. Usually these operations are stored in a
      NXtransformations group. But NeXus allows them to be stored anywhere.

      .. todo':'':'
        Add a definition for the reference point of a sensor.
  (NXtransformations):
    doc: |
      This is the group recommended for holding the chain of translation
      and rotation operations necessary to position the component within
      the instrument. The dependency chain may however traverse similar groups in
      other component groups.
