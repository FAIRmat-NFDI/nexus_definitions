      Typical examples for the granularization of processing units are:
      
      * A desktop computer with a single CPU; describe using one instance of NXcircuit.
      * A dual-socket server; describe using two instances of NXcircuit.
      * A server with two dual-socket server nodes; describe with four
        instances of NXcircuit surplus a field that defines their level
        in the hierarchy.
