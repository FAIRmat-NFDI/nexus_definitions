  Computational geometry description of a set of polygons in Euclidean space.
  
  Polygons are specialized polylines:
  
  * A polygon is a geometric primitive that is bounded by a closed polyline
  * All vertices of this polyline lay in the d-1 dimensional plane.
    whereas vertices of a polyline do not necessarily lay on a plane.
  * A polygon has at least three vertices.
  
  Each polygon is built from a sequence of vertices (points with identifiers).
  The members of a set of polygons may have a different number of vertices.
  Sometimes a collection/set of polygons is referred to as a soup of polygons.
  
  As three-dimensional objects, a set of polygons can be used to define the
  hull of what is effectively a polyhedron; however users are advised to use
  the specific :ref:`NXcg_polyhedron` base class if they wish to describe closed
  polyhedra. Even more general complexes can be thought of. An example are the
  so-called piecewise-linear complexes used in the TetGen library.
  
  As these complexes can have holes though, polyhedra without holes are one
  subclass of such complexes, users should rather design an own base class
  e.g. NXcg_polytope to describe such even more complex primitives instead
  of abusing this base class for such purposes.
symbols:
  doc: |
    The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  d: |
    The dimensionality, which has to be either 2 or 3.
  c: |
    The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of polygons.

  # n_unique: Number of unique points supporting the polygons.
  n_total: |
    The total number of vertices when visiting every polygon.
type: group
NXcg_polygon(NXcg_primitive):
  number_of_total_vertices(NX_UINT):
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
    doc: |
      The total number of vertices in the set.
  
  # detailed mesh-based representation
  polygons(NXcg_face_list_data_structure):
    doc: |
      Combined storage of all primitives of all polygons.
  polygonID(NXcg_face_list_data_structure):
    nameType: partial
    doc: |
      Individual storage of the mesh of each polygon.
  polygon_half_edgeID(NXcg_half_edge_data_structure):
    nameType: any
    doc: |
      Individual storage of each polygon as a graph.
  # properties of the polygon primitives
  edge_length(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    doc: |
      For each polygon its accumulated length along its edges.
    dimensions:
      rank: 1
      dim: (c,)
  interior_angle(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_ANGLE
    doc: |
      Interior angles for each polygon. There are as many values per polygon
      as the are number_of_vertices.
      The angle is the angle at the specific vertex, i.e. between the adjoining
      edges of the vertex according to the sequence in the polygons array.
      Usually, the winding_order field is required to interpret the value.
