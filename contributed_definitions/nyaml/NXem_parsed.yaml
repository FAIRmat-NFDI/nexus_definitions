  Application definition for electron microscopy research used for an RDM or
  exchange of electron microscopy research across RDMs.
  
  In line with the idea of NeXus application definitions, this schema is a
  specialized version of NXem_base in that fields and groups are specifically
  constrained, mainly with the effect that some quantities are required, so
  that a research data management system can rely on the existence of certain
  pieces of information without demanding further verification in its own
  source code or further harmonization or normalization what each piece of
  information means conceptually.
  
  This application definition is thus an example and blueprint how users
  can build specific application definitions by reusing em-specific base
  classes. The constraints of all these application definitions
  might be different than for the here exemplified NXem.
  
  Nevertheless, the key benefit remains: Many pieces of information are still
  conceptually the same, named in the same way and found in the same place
  in the hierarchy. This supports interoperability of electron microscopy data
  and is advantageous compared to having everybody using own formatting and
  conceptually not harmonized terms for their research.
  
  For the detailed rationale and explanation of the concept behind the
  NeXus electron microscopy class definitions please consult the preamble
  of the NXem_base base class.

NXem(NXem_base):
  # composing from NXem_base should work because NXem_base is composed from NXroot
  # just list what is required or recommended or optional
  # overwrite which known building blocks should get a different meaning
  # and add specific fields for which there is not yet a base class
  # this also strenghtens that people write base classes instead of
  # highly customized and deeply overwriting application definitions
  # from the NXem_base class

      A collection of all programs and libraries which are consider relevant
      to understand with which software tools this NeXus file instance was
      generated. Ideally, to enable a binary recreation from the input data.
      
      Examples include the name and version of the libraries
      used to write the instance. Ideally, the software which writes these
      NXprogram instances also includes the version of the set of NeXus classes
      i.e. the specific set of base classes, application definitions, and 
      contributed definitions with which the here described concepts can
      be resolved.
      
      For the `pynxtools library <https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/pynxtools>`_
      which is used by the `NOMAD <https://nomad-lab.eu/nomad-lab>`_
      research data management system, it makes sense to store e.g. the GitHub
      repository commit and respective submodule references used.
    exists: [min, 1, max, infty]
  # each NeXus file instance should have a default plot
  # however as there are cases when this cannot be assured we cannot
  # make the default required, one example is e.g. a NeXus instance
  # where scientists just store conventions without a default plot

# finally an example how to map e.g. a simple flat schema to NXem:
# https://www.zenodo.org/record/6513745, source path mapped on (->) target path
# for all source paths /SEM/ is the src path prefix
# for all target paths /entry1/ is the trg path prefix
# ID -> experiment_identifier
# External/alias ID -> none
# User -> map on NXuser instances
# Date -> use start_time and end_time respectively
# Affiliation -> map on NXuser instances
# DOIs -> none, map on NXcite instances
# Temperature (of what?) -> be more specific and add as property of group of relevance
# Relative humidity (of what? likely lab like temperature) -> NXsample
# Environmental gas -> NXsample
# Operator -> map on NXuser with specific role
# Instrument ID -> map on best matching field from NXfabrication in em_lab
# Sample ID -> NXsample/identifier
# Parent sample ID -> NXsample/sample_history
# Any dataset to be linked with this experiment (too vague for the I in FAIR) -> none
# Environmental protection during sample processing -> NXsample
# Pre-treatment -> own appdef and connect to NXsample/sample_history
# Measurement position (the example is totally unclear) -> NXstage_lab, coordinate system etc.
# Detector IDs -> NXdetector/identifier
# Accelerating voltage -> electron_source/voltage
# Current -> much more possibilities electron_source and NXoptical_system_em
# Magnification -> use NXoptical_system_em
# Image width -> implicit in roi/NXdata instances
# Image size -> see image width
# Acquisition mode (too vague) -> map on more expressive fields of NXem_base
# Storage tilt (what is this) for tilt see NXstage_lab
# Measurement date (how is it different from Date?
# Comments -> any of the description fields, in both cases not fair
# the respective TEM group has pixel coordinates, which is all much cleaner
# described using NXem_conventions, NXcoordinate_system, etc...
