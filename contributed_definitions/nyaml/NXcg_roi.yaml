  Base class for a region-of-interest (ROI) bound by geometric primitives.
  
  So-called region-of-interest(s) (ROIs) are typically used to describe a
  region in space (and time) where an observation is made or for which
  a computer simulation is performed with given boundary conditions.

    The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
    Use :ref:`NXcg_primitive` and :ref:`NXcoordinate_system` classes
    to define explicitly the reference frame in which the primitives are defined.
