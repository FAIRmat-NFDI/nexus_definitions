  A base class to explain baise_sweep which mainly define how the bias voltage sweep is performed in the experiment.

  The bais voltage sweep is a common technique used on the substance or sample or environment to study the change 
  in the behavior of the sample or substance or environment with the help of the probe.

# TODO: delete the iv_bias and bias_spectroscopy base classes.
type: group
NXbias_sweep(NXobject):
  bias_start(NX_NUMBER): 
    doc: |
      The starting value of the bias voltage.
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE
  bias_end(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      The ending value of the bias voltage.
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE
  sweep_start(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      The starting value of the sweep. 
      Usually, the sweep starts at the starting value of the bias voltage (which means both the bias_start and 
      sweep_start are the same). But, in some cases, the sweep can start at a different value might be intentional
      or due to the instrument's fault.
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE
  sweep_end(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      The ending value of the sweep. 
      Usually, the sweep ends at the ending value of the bias voltage (which means both the bias_end and 
      sweep_end are the same). But, in some cases, the sweep can end at a different value might be intentional
      or due to the instrument's fault.
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE
  sweep_number(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      The number of sweeps that are performed. 
      The number of sweeps is the number of times the bias voltage is swept from the starting value (sweep_start) to the 
      ending value  (sweep_end).
    unit: number of sweeps
  sweep_step(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      The step size of the sweep. 
      The step size is the difference between the two consecutive bias voltage values during the sweep.
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE
  sweep_rate(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      The rate at which the bias voltage is swept. 
      The rate is the speed at which the bias voltage is swept from the starting value to the ending value
      to perform a complete sweep.
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE/NX_TIME
  forward_sweep(NX_BOOL):
    doc: |
      The direction of the sweep. 
      If the forward_sweep is true, the sweep is performed from the higher value to the lower value 
      and false for vice-versa.
  settling_time(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      The time is taken to settle the bias voltage at the desired value. On each sweep usually, the system 
      takes time to settle the bias voltage at the next value.
    unit: NX_TIME
  reset_bias(NX_BOOL):
    doc: |
      The reset_bias is used to reset the bias voltage to the starting value after the sweep is completed.
  channels:
    doc: |
      The channels that are used to measure the data during the sweep.
  (NXpid):
    doc: |
      The PID controller data that is used to control the bias voltage at a desired value.  
  (NXdata): 
    doc: |
      The data collected from the experiment for example current, voltage, etc.
