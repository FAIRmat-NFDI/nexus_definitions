  Peak fitting of a one-dimensional spectrum.
symbols:
  doc: |
    The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  n_peaks: |
    Number of peaks.

NXpeak_model(NXprocess):
  region_REGION(NXfit_region):
    doc: |
      Subset of the abscisssa that is used for fitting.
      It is envisioned that regions are labeled as regions_0, regions_1, and so on.
  peak_PEAK(NXpeak):
    doc: |
      One spectral peak of the peak model.
      It is envisioned that peaks are labeled as peak_0, peak_1, and so on.
  background(NX_background):
    doc: |
      Description of the function used for background subtraction.
  envelope(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_ANY
    doc: |
      Resulting envelope of all NXpeak instances.
      
      Should have the same dimension as the `position` axes of the individual peaks.
  figure_of_merit(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
    doc: |
      Figure-of-merit, e.g., :math:`\Chi^2`, or the standard deviation of the residuals,
      to determine the goodness of fit, i.e., how well the peak model fits the measured
      observations.
      
      This value (which is a single number) is oftenused to guide adjustments to the
      fitting parameters in the peak fitting process.
  relative_concentration(NX_FLOAT):
    unit: NX_ANY
    doc: |
      Atomic concentration of each species defined by one peak in the peak model.
