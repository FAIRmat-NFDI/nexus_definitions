    Transfermatrix relationship between N input beams and M output beams.
    It contains a table with the relevant matricis to be used for different
    transmissitted properties (such as polarization, intensity, phase).

    Data structure for all transfermatrices of an optical element in a setup.
    For each combination of N input and M output beams and for L physical
    concept (i.e. beam intensity), one matrix can be defined.

    In this way, the transfermatrix table has the dimension NxM.

    For each entry, in this transfermatrix, there are L formalisms.
    Each formalism has the dimension math:`dim(L_i)xdim(L_i)`,
    whereby math:`L_i` is the specific physical concept (Intensity, polarization, direction).

    A beamsplitter with two input laser beams can have a total of
    four transfermatrices (2 Input x 2 Output).

    The dimension of the transfermatrix depends on the parameters.
    Examples are:
    1x1 for intensity/power
    2x2 for jones formalism
    3x3 for direction

    Dimension of the number of colums & rows for the matrix, which stores
    a scalar (dim1) or vector (dim3)
