  An application definition for optical spectroscopy experiments.
symbols:
  doc: Variables used throughout the document, e.g. dimensions or parameters.
  N_spectrum: |
    Length of the spectrum array (e.g. wavelength or energy) of the measured
    data.
  N_sensors: |
    Number of sensors used to measure parameters that influence the sample,
    such as temperature or pressure.
  N_measurements: |
    Number of measurements (1st dimension of measured_data array). This is
    equal to the number of parameters scanned. For example, if the experiment
    was performed at three different temperatures and two different pressures
    N_measurements = 2*3 = 6.
  N_detection_angles: |
    Number of detection angles of the beam reflected or scattered off the
    sample.
  N_incident_angles: Number of angles of incidence of the incident beam.
  N_observables: |
    Number of observables that are saved in a measurement. e.g. one for
    intensity, reflectivity or transmittance, two for Psi and Delta etc. This
    is equal to the second dimension of the data array 'measured_data' and the
    number of column names.

NXopt:

      An application definition template for optical spectroscopy experiments.

      A general optical experiment consists of a light or excitation source, a
      beam path, a sample + its stage + its environment, and a detection unit.
      Examples are reflection or transmission measurements, photoluminescence,
      Raman spectroscopy, ellipsometry etc.

                * Order the sensors according to number_of_parameters starting
                with the lowest number. If number_of_parameters is equal for
                two sensors order them alphabetically (sensor/parameter name).
                * The first sensor's j parameters should be ordered in the
                following way. The first N_measurements/number_of_parameters
                entries of the vector contain the first parameter (a1), the
                second N_measurements/number_of_parameters contain the second
                parameter (a2) etc., so the vector looks like:

                  a2,a2,...,a2,

                  aj,aj,...aj

                * The kth sensor's m parameters should be ordered in the
                following way:
                  [
                  p1,...p1,p2,...,p2,...pm,...,pm,

                  z1,z2,...,zn]

                For example, if the experiment was performed at three different
                temperatures (T1, T2, T3), two different pressures (p1, p2) and
                two different angles of incidence (a1, a2), then
                N_measurements = 12 and the order of the values for the various
                parameter vectors is:

                * angle_of_incidence: [a1,a1,a1,a1,a1,a1,a2,a2,a2,a2,a2,a2]
                * pressure: [p1,p1,p1,p2,p2,p2,p1,p1,p1,p2,p2,p2]
                * temperature: [T1,T2,T3,T1,T2,T3,T1,T2,T3,T1,T2,T3]

            For environmental measurements, the environment (liquid, vapor

            window) (looking from the sample). In case that the entry and exit
            windows are not the same type and do not have the same properties,
            use a second 'WINDOW(MXaperture)' field.

            The windows also add a phase shift to the light altering the
            measured signal. This shift has to be corrected based on measuring
            a known sample (reference sample) or the actual sample of interest
            in the environmental cell. State if a window correction has been

            considered as a separate experiment, and a link to the NeXus file
            should be added in reference_data_link in measured_data.

            The window is considered to be a part of the sample stage but also
            beam path. Hence, its position within the beam path should be

          layers, where the first entry is the chemical formula of the top
          layer (the one on the front surface, on which the light incident).

          details of the sample and its preparation.
