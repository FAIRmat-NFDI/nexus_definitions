  in the confined phase space.
type: group
NXscan_pattern(NXobject):
  SPEED(NX_NUMBER):
    nameType: partial
    unit: NX_ANY
    doc: |
      Define the scan speed in the different directions (e.g. forward or backward) along the axis.
      
      Rename the field, according to the name of the dimension or direction (e.g. forward_speed_x,
      forward_speed_y).
  repeats(NX_BOOLEAN):
    doc: |
      If scan repeats over the same scan region, use True, else False by default.
  scan_order(NX_CHAR_OR_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      On the same scan region a scan can be repeated over several times and the mesh scan group
      needs to be initialized multiple times with an specific scan order (e.g. A, B, ...,
      First, Second ...) which will be considered as a tag to each scan.
  NOTE(NXnote):
    nameType: any
    doc: |
      Takes note for individual scan or scan_order.
    description(NX_CHAR):
      doc: |
        The note, comment or description of the corresponding scan or scan_oder.
  channel_NAME:
    nameType: partial
    doc: |
      Name of the channel that records the scan data for the given dimension. The ending annotation 'N' is
      to represent the name of the dimensions.
      
      Rename the field, according to the name of the channel and dimension (e.g. piezo_scanner_x).
  scan_points_N(NX_NUMBER):
    nameType: partial
    doc: |
      Define the total number of points in the given axis scan to be performed.
      
      Rename the field, according to the name of the dimension (e.g. scan_points_x, scan_points_voltage).
  stepping_N(NX_NUMBER):
    nameType: partial
    doc: |
      The number of steps the probe jumps over the scan steps or points. This describes when not
      every point from the scan_points is measured along an axis.
      
      Rename the field, according to the name of the dimension (e.g. stepping_x, stepping_voltage).
    \@frog_leap_scan(NX_BOOLEAN):
      doc: |
        If the scan probe jumps over a number of scan steps or points (more than one)
        to perform each scan. By default, it is False.
  step_size_N(NX_NUMBER):
    nameType: partial
    unit: NX_ANY
    doc: |
      The length of each step in the scan on each dimension.
      
      Rename the field, according to the name of the dimension (e.g. step_size_x, step_size_voltage).
  continuous_N(NX_BOOLEAN):
    nameType: partial
    doc: |
      If the scan probe moves continuously over the scan points or steps, use True. The default value is False.
      Usually, continuous scanning is possible in one dimension. On other dimensions, the scan probe moves
      in steps.
      
      Rename the field, according to the name of the dimension (e.g. continuous_voltage).
  oscillating_N(NX_BOOLEAN):
    nameType: partial
    doc: |
      If the scan probe oscillates over the scan point, use True.
      The default value is False.
  oscillation_frequency(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      The number of oscillations on each scanning point per second.
  SCAN_data(NXdata):
    nameType: partial
    doc: |
      The scan data is the data collected during the scan.
      If the scan has several channels or derivatives from the channel data, please
      duplicate this NXdata group for each.
    DATA(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_ANY
      doc: |
        The scan data is the data collected during the scan.
