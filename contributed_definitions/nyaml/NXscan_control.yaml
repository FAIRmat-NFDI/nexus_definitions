  The scan_control group contains information about the scan control over a certain area.
scan_control:
  exists: optional
  scan_range(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    exists: optional
    doc: |
      The scan range (in STM experiment) is the area that the tip will scan. (e.g.
      5.000000E-9 5.000000E-9)
  scan_offset(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    exists: optional
    doc: |
      The scan offset (in STM experiment) is the position of the tip in the scan area.
      (e.g. -2.354637E-7 1.267476E-)
  scan_direction:
    exists: optional
    doc: |
      The scan direction (in STM experiment) is the direction from which side of the
      sample the tip starts scanning.
    enumeration: [down, up, top, bottom]
  scan_angle(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_ANGLE
    exists: optional
    doc: |
      The angle of scan (in STM experiment) with the bottom or top side (depends on the scan_direction
      field) of the sample. (e.g. 0.000E+0).
  scanfield(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Configure the scan frame like x position; y position; width; height. (e.g.
      3.11737E-9;29.1583E-9;15E-9;15E-9;0E+0)
  pixels_line(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Scan resolution by setting the Lines equal to Pixels.  (e.g. 512)
  lines(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Define the image resolution. (e.g. 512)
  speed_forw(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Define the scan forward speed in the forward direction. (m/s) (e.g. 11.7187E-9)
  speed_backw(NX_NUMBER):
    exists: optional
    doc: |
      Define the scan backward speed in the forward direction. (m/s) (e.g. 11.7187E-9)
            roi(NXtransformations):
  scan_DATA(NXdata):
    exists: optional
    data:
      doc: |
        The scan data is the data collected during the scan. If the scan has several channels or derivatives from the channel data, please
        duplicate this NXdata group for each. 
  circuit(NXcollection):
    exists: optional
  scan_channels:
      doc: |
        The scan channels are selected by users. (e.g. (A);Bias (V);Z (m);LI Demod 2 X
        (A);LI Demod 2 Y (A);LI Demod 1 X (A);LI Demod 1 Y (A)).
  scan_mode:
    doc: |
      The scan mode is the mode of the scan. (e.g. STM, AFM, etc.)
    enumeration: [STM, AFM, STS]
