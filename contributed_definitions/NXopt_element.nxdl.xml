         Properties of generic optical element in an experimental setup for optical
         spectroscopy.

    <field name="previous_optical_elements">
        <doc>
             Single element or list of elements pointing to the optical elements from which an
             optical beam originated to reach this optical element.
             This is used to describe a logical order of elements and for the whole setup.
             In this way, a "beam path" can be described (i.e., with starting point (light source) 
             and end point (photo detector)).
             
             Example: /entry/instrument/detector.

    <field name="purpose" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
             Description of the intended purpose of this optical element for
             the experimental setup.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="group" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
             Name of the group with which this element can be associated.
             For example, if a group of elements is used for second harmonic generation,
             all these elements have the group name "second harmonic generation".
             Is used for simplified setup vizualization (or description?).

    <group name="POSITION" type="NXtransformation">
        <!--instantiable: User may use cartesian coordinates to give the opt element position
or as well a z-axis description.
Not sure: The idea was to use @depends_on to describe the position by the previous element
by only using distance and angles? Is there redundent information?-->
        <doc>
             Location and orientation of the optical element. Note that even a
             simple distance can be given as a translation.
             
             You can use the @depends_on to describe from which optical element
             
             the transformation needs to be applied.
