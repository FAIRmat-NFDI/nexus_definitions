         Base class specialized for reporting a cuboidal stack of diffraction pattern.
         
         Diffraction pattern whether they were simulated or measured are the raw data
         for computational workflows to characterize the phase and orientation
         in crystalline regions in matter.
         
         Steps of post-processing the diffraction patterns should be documented using
         method-specific specialized base classes. All eventual post-processing of
         resulting orientation maps (2D or 3D) should be documented using
         base classes from the NXms family.

             Collected diffraction pattern as an image stack. As raw and closest to the
             first retrievable measured data as possible, i.e. do not use this
             container to store already averaged, filtered or whatever post-processed
             pattern unless these are generated unmodifiably in such manner by the
             instrument given the way how the instrument and control software
             was configured for your microscope session.

            <doc>
                 Array which resolves the scan point to which each pattern belongs.
                 Scan points are evaluated in sequence starting from scan point zero
                 until scan point n_sc - 1. Evaluating the cumulated of this array
                 decodes which pattern in intensity belongs to which scan point.
                 
                 Take an example with three scan points: The first scan point has one
                 pattern, the second has three pattern, the last scan point has no
                 pattern. In this case the scan_point_identifier are 0, 1, 1, 1.
                 The length of the scan_point_identifier array is four because four
                 pattern were measured in total.
                 
                 In most cases usually one pattern is averaged by the detector for
                 some amount of time and then reported as one pattern.
