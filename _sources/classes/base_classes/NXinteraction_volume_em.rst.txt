**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Base class to describe the volume of interaction for particle-matter interaction ...

      Base class to describe the volume of interaction for particle-matter interaction.

      Computer models like Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics / electron- or ion-beam
      interaction simulations can be used to qualify and (or) quantify the shape of
      the interaction volume. Results of such simulations can be summary statistics
      or single-particle-resolved sets of trajectories.

      Explicit or implicit descriptions of the geometry of this
      interaction volume are possible:

      * An implicit description is via a set of electron/specimen interactions
        represented ideally as trajectory data from the computer simulation.
      * An explicit description is via iso-contour surface using either
        a simulation grid or a triangulated surface mesh of the approximated
        iso-contour surface evaluated at specific threshold values.
        Iso-contours could be computed from electron or particle flux through
        an imaginary control surface (the iso-surface) or energy-levels
        (e.g. the case of X-rays). Details depend on the model.
      * Another explicit description is via theoretical models which may
        be relevant e.g. for X-ray spectroscopy

      Further details on how the interaction volume can be quantified
      is available in the literature for example:
