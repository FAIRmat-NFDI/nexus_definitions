**Description**:

      Base class to detail a set of rotations, orientations, and disorientations.

      For getting a more detailed insight into the discussion of the
      parameterized description of orientations in materials science see:

      * `H.-J. Bunge <https://doi.org/10.1016/C2013-0-11769-2>`_
      * `T. B. Britton et al. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matchar.2016.04.008>`_
      * `D. Rowenhorst et al. <https://doi.org/10.1088/0965-0393/23/8/083501>`_
      * `A. Morawiec <https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-09156-2>`_

      Once orientations are defined, one can continue to characterize the
      misorientation and specifically the disorientation. The misorientation describes
      the rotation that is required to register the lattices of two oriented objects
      (like crystal lattice) into a crystallographic equivalent orientation:

      * `R. Bonnet <https://doi.org/10.1107/S0567739480000186>`_

      The concepts of mis- and disorientation are relevant when analyzing the
      crystallography of interfaces.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **c**: The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of value tuples.

  **n_phases**: How many phases with usually different crystal and symmetry are distinguished.

**Groups cited**:
  none

        Reference to an instance of :ref:`NXcoordinate_system` which contextualizes
        how the here reported parameterized quantities can be interpreted.

  .. _/NXrotations/crystal_symmetry-field:

  .. index:: crystal_symmetry (field)

  **crystal_symmetry**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [n_phases]) 

    .. collapse:: Point group which defines the symmetry of the crystal. ...

        Point group which defines the symmetry of the crystal.

        This has to be at least a single string. If crystal_symmetry is not
        provided, point group 1 is assumed.

        In the case that misorientation or disorientation fields are used
        and the two crystal sets resolve for phases with a different
        crystal symmetry, this field needs to encode two strings:
        The first string is for phase A. The second string is for phase B.
        An example of this most complex case is the description of the
        disorientation between crystals adjoining a hetero-phase boundary.

  .. _/NXrotations/sample_symmetry-field:

  .. index:: sample_symmetry (field)

  **sample_symmetry**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [n_phases]) 

    .. collapse:: Point group which defines an assumed symmetry imprinted upon processing ...

        Point group which defines an assumed symmetry imprinted upon processing
        the material/sample which could give rise to or may justify to use a
        simplified description of rotations, orientations, misorientations,
        and disorientations via numerical procedures that are known as
        symmetrization.

        If sample_symmetry is not provided, point group 1 is assumed.

        The traditionally used symmetrization operations within the texture
        community in Materials Science, though, have become obsolete thanks
        to improvements in methods, software, and available computing power.

        Therefore, users are encouraged to set the sample_symmetry to 1 (triclinic).

        In practice one often faces situations where indeed these assumed
        symmetries are anyway not fully observed, and thus an accepting of
        eventual inaccuracies just for the sake of reporting a simplified
        symmetrized description should be avoided.

        The set of rotations expressed in quaternion parameterization considering
        crystal_symmetry and sample_symmetry. Rotations which should be

        The set of rotations expressed in Euler angle parameterization considering
        the same applied symmetries as detailed for the field rotation_quaternion.
        To interpret Euler angles correctly, it is necessary to inspect the rotation
        conventions behind reference_frame to resolve which of the many possible
        Euler-angle conventions (Bunge ZXZ, XYZ, Kocks, Tait, etc.) were used.

        The set of orientations expressed in quaternion parameterization and
        obeying symmetry for equivalent cases as detailed in crystal_symmetry
        and sample_symmetry. The supplementary field is_antipodal can be used
        to mark orientations with the antipodal property.

    .. collapse:: The set of orientations expressed in Euler angle parameterization following ...

        The set of orientations expressed in Euler angle parameterization following
        the same assumptions like for orientation_quaternion.
        To interpret Euler angles correctly, it is necessary to inspect the rotation
        conventions behind reference_frame to resolve which of the many Euler-angle
        conventions possible (Bunge ZXZ, XYZ, Kocks, Tait, etc.) were used.

        obeying symmetry operations for equivalent misorientations
        as defined by crystal_symmetry and sample_symmetry.

        as for the latter the angular argument is expected to be the minimal
        obeying symmetries.
