**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXinstrument`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Base class for instrument-related details of a real or simulated electron micros ...

      Base class for instrument-related details of a real or simulated electron microscope.

      For collecting data and experiments which are simulations of an electron
      microscope (or such session) use the :ref:`NXem` application definition and
      the :ref:`NXevent_data_em` groups it provides.

      This base class implements the concept of :ref:`NXem` whereby (meta)data are distinguished
      whether these typically change during a session (dynamic) or not (static metadata).
      This design allows to store e.g. hardware related concepts only once instead of demanding
      that each image or spectrum from the session needs to be stored also with the static metadata.

**Symbols**:

  **type**: (recommended) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

    .. collapse:: Different types of electron microscopes exist: ...

        Different types of electron microscopes exist:

        * sem, a scanning electron microscope without focused-ion beam capabilities
        * fib, a scanning electron microscope with focused-ion beam capabilities
          irrespective whether these were used or not
        * tem, a transmission electron microscope

        NXem is one joint data model that can be used to document research that is performed
        with several of these types of microscopes (SEM, TEM, or FIB). The NXem data model
        stresses that these types of instruments despite having several differences are still all
        electron beamlines with which to probe electron and/or ion matter interaction and in fact
        in practice have many similarities in how they are used, the components, they contain, etc.

        This field can be used in research data management systems for enabling a categorization
        or tagging of experiments without having to analyze if groups like NXibeam_column are present
        (which would indicate type is fib) or if certain lens configurations or instrument models are used
        which suggests the microscope is a scanning (sem) or transmission electron microscope (tem):

        Any of these values: ``sem`` | ``fib`` | ``tem``

        Description of the type of the detector.

        Electron microscopes have typically multiple detectors.
        Different technologies are in use like CCD, scintillator,
        direct electron, CMOS, or image plate to name but a few.

        Stages in an electron microscope are multi-functional devices.

        Stages enable experimentalists the application of controlled external stimuli
        on the specimen. Modern stages realize a hierarchy of components.
        A multi-axial tilt rotation holder is a good example where the control of
        each degree of freedom is technically implemented via providing instances
        of e.g. :ref:`NXpositioner` or :ref:`NXactuator` that achieve the rotating
        and positioning of the specimen.

        The physical process of mounting a specimen on a stage in practice often
        comes with an own hierarchy of fixtures to bridge e.g. length scales technically.
        An example from atom probe microscopy is that researchers may work
        with wire samples which are clipped into a larger fixing unit to enable
        careful specimen handling. Alternatively, a microtip is a silicon post
        upon which e.g. an atom probe specimen is mounted. Multiple of such microtips
        are then grouped into a microtip array to conveniently enable loading of multiple
        specimens into the instrument with fewer operations. There are further scenarios
        typically encountered related to mounting and locating specimens inside an
        electron microscope, a few examples follow:

        * A nanoparticle on a copper grid. The copper grid is the holder.
          This grid itself is fixed to a stage.
        * An atom probe specimen fixed in a stub. In this case the stub can be
          considered the holder, while the cryostat temperature control unit is
          a component of the stage.
        * For in-situ experiments with e.g. chips with read-out electronics
          as actuators, the chips are again placed in a larger unit. A typical
          example are in-situ experiments using e.g. the tools of `Protochips <https://www.protochips.com>`_.
        * Other examples are (quasi) in-situ experiments where experimentalists
          anneal or deform the specimen via e.g. in-situ tensile testing machines
          which are mounted on the specimen holder.

        In contrast to the stage, the nanoprobe is an additional manipulator that is a specifically
        frequently found component of FIB/SEM instruments. A nanoprobe is used to pick up and
