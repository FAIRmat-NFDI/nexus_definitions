        .. index:: plotting

        Declares which child group contains a path leading
        to a :ref:`NXdata` group.

        It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
        to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
        See https://www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
        for a summary of the discussion.

        The process by which the resolution was determined.

        Any of these values: ``estimated`` | ``derived`` | ``calibrated`` | ``other``

  .. _/NXresolution/resolution-field:

  **resolution**: (optional) :ref:`NX_FLOAT <NX_FLOAT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_ANY <NX_ANY>`} 

    The resolution of the physical quantity.

  .. index:: relative_resolution_errors (field)

  **relative_resolution_errors**: (optional) :ref:`NX_FLOAT <NX_FLOAT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_DIMENSIONLESS <NX_DIMENSIONLESS>`}

        A description of the resolution formula to determine the resolution from a set of symbols as
        entered by the `formula_...` fields. This should be an english description of the math used.

  .. _/NXresolution/note-group:

  **note**: (optional) :ref:`NXnote` 

    Additional details of the estimate or description of the calibration procedure

  .. _/NXresolution/response_function-group:

  **response_function**: (optional) :ref:`NXdata` 

    .. collapse:: The response of the instrument or part of the instrument to a infinitesimally  ...

        The response of the instrument or part of the instrument to a infinitesimally sharp input signal
        along the physical quantity of this group.
        This is also sometimes called instrument response function for time resolution or
        point spread function for spatial response.
        The resolution is typically determined by taking the full width at half maximum (FWHM)
        of the response function.

        This could have an AXISNAME field ```input``` (the input axis or grid of the response function)
        and a ``DATA`` field ```magnitude```. Both of these should have the same unit. The dimensions
        should match those of the :ref:`resolution </NXresolution/resolution-field>` field.

  .. _/NXresolution/formula_symbols-group:

    .. collapse:: Symbols linking to another path in the NeXus tree to be referred to from the ...

        Symbols linking to another path in the NeXus tree to be referred to from the
        `resolution_formula_description` field. The ``TERM``  should be a valid path inside this application
        definition, i.e., of the form /entry/instrument/my_part/my_field.

  .. _/NXresolution/CALIBRATION-group:

  :bolditalic:`CALIBRATION`: (optional) :ref:`NXcalibration` 

    For storing details and data of a calibration to derive a resolution from data.
