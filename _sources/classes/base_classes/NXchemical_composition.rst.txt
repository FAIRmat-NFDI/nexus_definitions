**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  (Chemical) composition of a sample or a set of things.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **n**: The number of samples or things.

**Groups cited**:

        Reporting compositions as atom and weight percent yields both
        dimensionless quantities but their conceptual interpretation differs.
        A normalization based on atom_percent counts relative to the
        total number of atoms which are of a particular type.
        By contrast, weight_percent normalization factorizes in the
        respective mass of the elements. Software libraries that work with units
        (like pint in Python) are challenged by these differences as at.-% and
        wt.-% are both fractional quantities.

        Any of these values: ``atom_percent`` | ``weight_percent``

  .. _/NXchemical_composition/total-field:

  .. index:: total (field)

  **total**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [n]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`}

        Total formula mass or number of atoms, depending on the
        normalization stated in the normalization field.

        If this group is used to report the composition of elements from the periodic table,
        the group should use the chemical symbol of that element. For other case the
        group name is unconstrained.

    **amount**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [n]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`}

          Count or weight which, when divided by total yields the composition
          of this element, isotope, molecule, or ion.

    .. _/NXchemical_composition/ELEMENT/composition-field:

    **composition**: (optional) :ref:`NX_FLOAT <NX_FLOAT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_DIMENSIONLESS <NX_DIMENSIONLESS>`}

          Composition value for the element/ion referred to under name.
          Composition is reported either normalized for atomic or weight
          percent. The field normalization should be used to communicate
          this explicitly. Composition should be reported consistently
          for all instances ELEMENT.

    .. index:: composition_errors (field)

    **composition_errors**: (recommended) :ref:`NX_FLOAT <NX_FLOAT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_DIMENSIONLESS <NX_DIMENSIONLESS>`} 

      Magnitude of the standard deviation of the composition.
