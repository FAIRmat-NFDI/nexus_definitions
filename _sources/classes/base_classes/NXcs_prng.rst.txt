**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Computer science description of pseudo-random number generator. ...

      Computer science description of pseudo-random number generator.

      The purpose of this base class is to identify if exactly the same sequence
      can be reproduced, like for a PRNG or not (for a true physically random source).

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

        Physical approach or algorithm whereby random numbers are generated.

        Different approaches for generating random numbers with a computer exists.
        Some use a dedicated physical device whose the state is unpredictable
        (physically). Some use a strategy of mangling information from the system
        clock. Also in this case the sequence is not reproducible without having
        additional pieces of information.

        In most cases though so-called pseudo-random number generator (PRNG)
        algorithms are used. These yield a deterministic sequence of practically
        randomly appearing numbers. These algorithms differ in their quality in
        how close the resulting sequences are random, i.e. sequentially
        uncorrelated. Nowadays one of the most commonly used algorithm is the
        MersenneTwister (mt19937).

        Any of these values: ``physical`` | ``system_clock`` | ``mt19937`` | ``other``

        Parameter of the PRNG controlling its initialization
        and thus controlling the specific sequence generated.

        Number of initial draws from the PRNG after its initialized with the seed.
        These initial draws are typically discarded in an effort to equilibrate the
        sequence. If no warmup was performed or if warmup procedures are unclear,
        users should set the value to zero.

        Name of the PRNG implementation and version. If such information is not
        available or if the PRNG type was set to other the DOI to the publication
        or the source code should be given.
