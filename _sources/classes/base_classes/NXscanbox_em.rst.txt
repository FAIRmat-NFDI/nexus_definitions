  base class, extends :ref:`NXcomponent`

**Description**:

      Scan box and coils which deflect a beam of charged particles in a controlled manner.

      The scan box is instructed by (an) instance(s) of :ref:`NXprogram`, some control software,
      which is not necessarily the same program as the one controlling other parts of the instrument.

      The scanbox directs the probe of charged particles (electrons, ions)
      to controlled locations according to a scan scheme and plan.

        Name of the typically tech-partner-specific term that specifies an
        automated protocol which details how the components of the scan_box
        and the instrument work together to achieve a controlled
        scanning of the beam (over the sample surface).

        Oftentimes users do not need to or are not able to disentangle the intricate
        details of the spatiotemporal dynamics of their instrument. Instead, often
        they rely on the assumption that the instrument and its controlling programs
        work as expected. The field scan_schema can be used to add some constraints
        on how the beam was scanned over the surface.

        Time period during which the beam remains at one position.

        This concept is related to term `Dwell Time`_ of the EMglossary standard.

        Time period during which the beam moves from the final position of one scan
        line to the starting position of the subsequent scan line.

        This concept is related to term `Flyback Time`_ of the EMglossary standard.

        Details about components which realize the deflection technically.

        This concept should be used for all those components that implement
        the scanning of the beam, while components like beam blankers etc. should
        use rather the NXdeflector concept of the NXebeam_column base class.
