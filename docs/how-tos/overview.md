# How-tos we want to write

This is just an overview of how tos we [agreed](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/data-modeling/blob/main/mpes/meetings/2023-10-04_documentation.md#decisions) to write for nexus. Eventually, there should be a documentation file/page for each of them.

- I have a nexus file, how to upload to nomad
- I have a nexus file and additional metadata, what do I do?
- I have a supported vendor file but no eln data how can I make a corresponding nomad eln?
- I have multiple nexus files and want to combine them into one nexus (master) file which is compliant to an application definition (future discussion: how do we want to support/distribute this in nomad/pynxtools?)
