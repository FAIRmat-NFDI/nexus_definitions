**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXem_method`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Base class for method-specific generic imaging. ...

      Base class for method-specific generic imaging.

      In the majority of cases simple d-dimensional regular scan patterns are used
      to probe a region-of-interest (ROI). Examples can be single point aka spot
      measurements, line profiles, or (rectangular) surface mappings.
      The latter pattern is the most frequently used.

      For now the base class provides for scans for which the settings,
      binning, and energy resolution is the same for each scan point.

**Symbols**:


  **n_images**: Number of images in the stack.

  **n_y**: Number of pixel per image in the slow direction.

  **n_x**: Number of pixel per image in the fast direction.
