===================
NXcg_polyhedron_set
===================

**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXcg_primitive_set`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Computational geometry description of a set of polyhedra in Euclidean space. ...

      Computational geometry description of a set of polyhedra in Euclidean space.

      Polyhedra or so-called cells (especially in the convex of tessellations) are
      constructed from polygon meshes. Polyhedra may make contact to allow a usage
      of this base class for a description of tessellations.

      For the description of more complicated manifolds and especially for polyhedra
      with holes, users are advised to check if their particular needs are described
      by creating customized instances of an :ref:`NXcg_polygon_set`.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **c**: The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of polyhedra.

  **n_e_total**: The total number of edges for all polyhedra.

  **n_f_total**: The total number of faces for all polyhedra.

**Groups cited**:
