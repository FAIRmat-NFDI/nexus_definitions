**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXcg_ellipsoid_set`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Computational geometry description of a set of spheres. ...

      Computational geometry description of a set of spheres.

      Each sphere can have a different radius but all need to have finite volume.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **d**: The dimensionality, which has to be at least 2.

  **c**: The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of circles or spheres.

**Groups cited**:
  none

**Structure**:

  .. _/NXcg_sphere_set/radius-field:

  .. index:: radius (field)

  **radius**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_LENGTH <NX_LENGTH>`} 

    In the case that all spheres have the same radius.

  .. _/NXcg_sphere_set/radii-field:

  .. index:: radii (field)

  **radii**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [c]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_LENGTH <NX_LENGTH>`} 

    .. collapse:: In the case that spheres have different radius use this ...

        In the case that spheres have different radius use this
        instead of the radius field.
