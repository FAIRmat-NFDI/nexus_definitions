**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXcg_primitive_set`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Computational geometry description of a set of points. ...

      Computational geometry description of a set of points.

      Points may have an associated time value. Users are advised though to store
      time data of point sets rather as instances of time events, where for each
      point in time there is an :ref:`NXcg_point_set` instance which specifies the
      points' locations.

      This is a frequent situation in experiments and computer simulations, where
      positions of points are taken at the same point in time (real time or
      simulated physical time). Thereby, the storage of redundant time stamp
      information per point is considered as obsolete.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **d**: The dimensionality.

  **c**: The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of points.

**Groups cited**:
  none

**Structure**:

  .. _/NXcg_point_set/position-field:

  .. index:: position (field)

  **position**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` (Rank: 2, Dimensions: [c, d]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_ANY <NX_ANY>`} 

    Coordinates of the points.

  .. _/NXcg_point_set/time-field:

  .. index:: time (field)

  **time**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [c]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_TIME <NX_TIME>`} 

    .. collapse:: (Elapsed) time for each point. ...

        (Elapsed) time for each point.

        If the field time is needed contextualize the time_offset relative to which
        time values are defined. Alternative store timestamp.

  .. _/NXcg_point_set/timestamp-field:

  .. index:: timestamp (field)

  **timestamp**: (optional) :ref:`NX_DATE_TIME <NX_DATE_TIME>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [c]) 

    ISO8601 with local time zone offset for each point.

  .. _/NXcg_point_set/time_offset-field:

  .. index:: time_offset (field)

  **time_offset**: (optional) :ref:`NX_DATE_TIME <NX_DATE_TIME>` 

    .. collapse:: ISO8601 with local time zone offset that serves as the reference ...

        ISO8601 with local time zone offset that serves as the reference
        for values in the field time.
