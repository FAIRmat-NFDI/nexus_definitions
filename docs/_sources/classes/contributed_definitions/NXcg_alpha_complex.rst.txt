        Type of alpha complex following the terminology used by CGAL for now.

        Basic means (unweighted) alpha shapes. Alpha_wrapping means meshes
        created using the alpha_wrapping algorithm.

        Any of these values: ``convex_hull`` | ``alpha_shape`` | ``alpha_wrapping``

        been regularized or not.

        The alpha parameter, i.e. the radius of the alpha-sphere that
        is used when computing the alpha complex.

  .. _/NXcg_alpha_complex/offset-field:

  .. index:: offset (field)

  **offset**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_LENGTH <NX_LENGTH>`}

  .. _/NXcg_alpha_complex/point_setID-group:

  **point_setID**: (optional) :ref:`NXcg_point_set` 

    Point cloud for which the alpha shape or wrapping has been computed.

  .. _/NXcg_alpha_complex/triangle_setID-group:

  **triangle_setID**: (optional) :ref:`NXcg_triangle_set` 

    Triangle soup for which the alpha wrapping has been computed.

  .. _/NXcg_alpha_complex/triangle_meshID-group:

  **triangle_meshID**: (optional) :ref:`NXcg_triangle_set` 

    Triangle mesh representing the alpha complex.
