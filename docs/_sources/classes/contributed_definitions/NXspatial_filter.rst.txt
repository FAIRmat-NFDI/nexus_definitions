**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Base class for a spatial filter for objects within a region-of-interest (ROI). ...

      Base class for a spatial filter for objects within a region-of-interest (ROI).

      Objects can be points or objects composed from other geometric primitives.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **n_hexahedra**: Number of hexahedra.

  **n_cylinders**: Number of cylinders.

  **n_ellipsoids**: Number of ellipsoids.

  **n_polyhedra**: Number of polyhedra.

    .. collapse:: Qualitative statement which describes the logical operations ...

        Qualitative statement which describes the logical operations
        that define which objects will be included and which excluded:

        * entire_dataset, no filter is applied, all objects are included.
        * union_of_primitives, a filter with (possibly non-axis-aligned) geometric
          primitives. Objects in or on the surface of the primitives are included.
          All other objects are excluded.
        * bitmask, a boolean array whose bits encode with 1 which objects
          are included. Bits set to zero encode which objects are excluded.
          Users of python can use the bitfield operations
          of the numpy package to work with bitfields.

        Any of these values: ``entire_dataset`` | ``union_of_primitives`` | ``bitmask``
