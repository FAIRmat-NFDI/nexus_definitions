      Properties of generic beam device in an experimental setup.

      Any beam related devices like source, detector, filter, mirror,
      beamsplitter, ... which may modifies a beam in an experimental setup
      can be described here with its experimental position and relationship
      to the other beam devices in the setup.

        Single device or list of devices pointing to the devices from which an
        beam originated to reach this device.
        This is used to describe a logical order of devices and for the whole setup.
        In this way, a "beam path" can be described (i.e., with starting point (light source) 
        and end point (photo detector)).

        Example: /entry/instrument/detector.

  .. _/NXbeam_device/purpose-field:

  .. index:: purpose (field)

  **purpose**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

    .. collapse:: Description of the intended purpose of this device for ...

        Description of the intended purpose of this device for
        the experimental setup.

  .. _/NXbeam_device/group-field:

  .. index:: group (field)

  **group**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

    .. collapse:: Name of the group with which this device can be associated. ...

        Name of the group with which this device can be associated.
        For example, if a group of devices is used for second harmonic generation,
        all these devices have the group name "second harmonic generation".
        Is used for simplified setup vizualization (or description?).

  .. _/NXbeam_device/TRANSFORMATIONS-group:

  **TRANSFORMATIONS**: (optional) :ref:`NXtransformations` 

    .. collapse:: Location and orientation of the device. Note that even a ...

        Location and orientation of the device. Note that even a
        simple distance can be given as a translation.

        You can use the @depends_on to describe from which device
        the transformation needs to be applied.
