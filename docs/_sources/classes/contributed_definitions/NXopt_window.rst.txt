**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXaperture`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: A window of a cryostat, heater, vacuum chamber or a simple glass slide. ...

      A window of a cryostat, heater, vacuum chamber or a simple glass slide.

      This first verion originates from NXopt to describe cryostate windows
      and possible influences for ellipsometry measurements.

      For environmental measurements, the environment (liquid, vapor
      etc.) is enclosed in a cell, which has windows both in the
      direction of the source (entry window) and the detector (exit
      window) (looking from the sample). In case that the entry and exit
      windows are not the same type and do not have the same properties,
      use a second 'WINDOW(NXaperture)' field.

      The windows also add a phase shift to the light altering the
      measured signal. This shift has to be corrected based on measuring
      a known sample (reference sample) or the actual sample of interest
      in the environmental cell. State if a window correction has been
      performed in 'window_effects_corrected'. Reference data should be
      considered as a separate experiment, and a link to the NeXus file
      should be added in reference_data_link in measured_data.

      The window is considered to be a part of the sample stage but also
      beam path. Hence, its position within the beam path should be
      defined by the 'depends_on' field.

            Link to the NeXus file which describes the reference data if a
            reference measurement for window correction was performed.
            Ideally, the reference measurement was performed on a reference
            sample and on the same sample, and using the same conditions as
            for the actual measurement with and without windows. It should
            have been conducted as close in time to the actual measurement
            as possible.
