**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Application definition for temperature-dependent IV curve measurements ...

      Application definition for temperature-dependent IV curve measurements
      #2023.19.7 This Nexus file is currently only for STS data, it will be updated to handle the
      STM image mode in the future with a focus on bias spectroscopy in Scanning Tunneling Microscopy.

      In this application definition, times should be specified always together with a UTC offset.

      This is the application definition describing temperature (T) dependent current voltage (IV) curve
      measurements. For this, a temperature is set. After reaching the temperature, a voltage sweep
      is performed. For each voltage, a current is measured.
      Then, the next desired temperature is set and an IV measurement is performed.
      The data can be visualized in a tensor with:
      I (NXsensor_C, NXsoftware_Read_offset, NXcircuit)
      parameters:
      V has (NXsource+offset, NXsoftware_Scan_offset, NXsensor_V, NXcircuit)
      T has (NXsource, NXsoftware_Scan_offset, NXsensor_T)
      x has (NXsoftware_Scan_offset)
      y has (NXsoftware_Scan_offset)
      z has (NXsoftware_Scan_offset)

                  The Signals Period represents the rate at which signals are transferred to
                  the host computer, which operates the control software. This rate may
                  be 10 times lower than the sampling rate, as the real-time engine internally
                  oversamples the signal. If desired, you may have the option to reduce the oversampling
                  to 1, enabling higher frequency resolution in the Spectrum Analyzer. (e.g. 10)

                  The update rate is utilized in various processes, including the History Graph,
                  Auto-Approach, and multiple Programming Interface functions. It may be
                  configured to a 20 ms interval. Any additional timings must strictly be integer
                  multiples of this base value. While it is possible to set these additional
                  timings to different values, the actual timing value will automatically be
                  adjusted to become a multiple of the Acquisition Period. (e.g. 20E-3)

                  The update rate of animated graphical indicators, such as graphs and sliders,

                  per second. Increasing this period can help reduce the processor load on the
                  graphical user interface, particularly on slower computers. It is important to
                  note that this update rate solely impacts the user interface and does not affect

                  The Measurements period determines the integration time required for precise
                  measurements, primarily utilized in sweep modules. It is particularly useful for
                  tasks such as recording force-distance curves or cantilever resonances. For
                  swift measurements with small steps, a value of 40 ms is often adequate. For
                  regular use, a range of 300-500 ms may be recommended, but when capturing the
                  resonance of a high-Q cantilever, longer values in the range of several seconds
                  might be necessary. Usually, this parameter does not require manual adjustment
                  within this module, as the sweep modules automatically set this value according
                  to the sweep timings. (e.g. 500E-3)
