**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Base classes definition for bias spectroscopy. ...

      Base classes definition for bias spectroscopy.

      Bias sweeps while measuring arbitrary channels with I(V) curves.

**Symbols**:

  No symbol table

**Groups cited**:
  none

**Structure**:

  .. _/NXbias_spectroscopy/channels-field:

  .. index:: channels (field)

  **channels**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

    Select the channels to record.

  .. _/NXbias_spectroscopy/reset_bias-field:

  .. index:: reset_bias (field)

  **reset_bias**: (optional) :ref:`NX_BOOLEAN <NX_BOOLEAN>` 

    .. collapse:: If chosen, the Bias voltage resets to its initial value (before the sweep init ...

        If chosen, the Bias voltage resets to its initial value (before the sweep initiation) at 
        the conclusion of the spectroscopy measurement. When this option is not selected, the Bias 
        voltage maintains the last value acquired during the sweep. This functionality proves 
        beneficial, especially when combining multiple sweep segments. As an illustration of an 
        automated measurement: turn off the z-Controller, commence spectroscopy sweep segments (
        forward sweep only, without resetting the bias), restore the bias to its initial value, 
        and then turn on the z-Controller.

  .. _/NXbias_spectroscopy/record_final_z-field:

  .. index:: record_final_z (field)

  **record_final_z**: (optional) :ref:`NX_BOOLEAN <NX_BOOLEAN>` 

    .. collapse:: Select whether to record the Z position during Z averaging time at the end of ...

        Select whether to record the Z position during Z averaging time at the end of
        the sweep (after Z control time) and store the average value in the header of
        the file when saving. Using this option increases the sweep time by Z averaging
        time.

        Select whether to set the Lock-In to run during the measurement. When using this
        feature, make sure the Lock-In is configured correctly and settling times are
        set to twice the Lock-In period at least. This option is ignored when Lock-In is
        already running. This option is disabled if the Sweep Mode is MLS and the flag
        to configure the Lock-In per segment in the Multiline segment editor is set.

  **num_pixel**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` 

    .. collapse:: Define the sweep number of points, that is, the maximum spectrum resolution eq ...

        Define the sweep number of points, that is, the maximum spectrum resolution eq.
        Bias window divide by Num Pixel.

  .. _/NXbias_spectroscopy/z_avg_time-field:

  .. index:: z_avg_time (field)

  **z_avg_time**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_TIME <NX_TIME>`} 

    .. collapse:: Duration over which the Z position is recorded and averaged before and after t ...

        Duration over which the Z position is recorded and averaged before and after the
        sweep (the latter only if Record final Z position is selected in the Advanced
        section). After the initial z averaging time, if Z-Controller to Hold is
        selected in the Advanced section, the z-Controller is set to hold and the tip is
        placed at the previously averaged z position (plus z offset).

  .. _/NXbias_spectroscopy/sw_filter_type-field:

        Select a filter to smooth the displayed data. When saving, if any filter is selected, 
        filtered data are saved to file along with the unfiltered data.

  .. _/NXbias_spectroscopy/sw_filter_order-field:

  .. index:: sw_filter_order (field)

  **sw_filter_order**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>`

        filter.

    .. collapse:: Offset added to the initial averaged position Zaver before starting to sweep. ...

        Offset added to the initial averaged position Zaver before starting to sweep.
        This parameter is disabled when Z-Controller to Hold is deselected in the 
        Advanced section. The LED “Alt” next to the Z offset indicates if an alternate 
        Z-controller setpoint is enabled.

  .. _/NXbias_spectroscopy/settling_time-field:

  .. index:: settling_time (field)

        the initial value.

  .. _/NXbias_spectroscopy/z_control_time-field:

  .. index:: z_control_time (field)

    .. collapse:: Time during which the Z-Controller is enabled once a sweep has finished.  ...

        Time during which the Z-Controller is enabled once a sweep has finished. 
        When averaging multiple sweeps (i.e. Sweeps>1), the Z-Controller is enabled
        for this duration between each sweep. After the last sweep, it will wait the
        specified time before continuing a running scan. This ensures each sweep 
        reliably starts from the same position. This parameter is disabled when 
        Z-Controller to Hold is deselected in the Advanced section.

  .. _/NXbias_spectroscopy/max_slew_rate-field:

        (V/s)

  .. _/NXbias_spectroscopy/backward_sweep-field:

  .. index:: backward_sweep (field)

  **backward_sweep**: (optional) :ref:`NX_BOOLEAN <NX_BOOLEAN>` 

    Select whether to measure the backward (return) sweep or the forward only.

        Select whether to set the Z-Controller on hold (i.e. disabled) during the sweep. 
        It is selected by default. When deselected, Z-offset and Z control time parameters
        are disabled.
