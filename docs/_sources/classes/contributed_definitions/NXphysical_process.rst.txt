**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: A planned or unplanned process which results in physical changes in a specified  ...

      A planned or unplanned process which results in physical changes in a specified material.

      A physical change involve changes only in intermolecular forces, not in the chemical bonds.
      Examples include sample preparation, material transformation, or (partially) destructive measurements.

**Symbols**:

  No symbol table

  **start_time**: (optional) :ref:`NX_DATE_TIME <NX_DATE_TIME>` 

    .. collapse:: ISO 8601 formatted time code (with local time zone offset to UTC information ...

        ISO 8601 formatted time code (with local time zone offset to UTC information
        included) when this process started.

  **end_time**: (optional) :ref:`NX_DATE_TIME <NX_DATE_TIME>` 

    .. collapse:: ISO 8601 formatted time code (with local time zone offset to UTC information ...

        ISO 8601 formatted time code (with local time zone offset to UTC information
        included) when this process ended.

  .. _/NXphysical_process/description-field:

  .. index:: description (field)

  **description**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

    Short description of the activity.

  .. _/NXphysical_process/method-field:

  .. index:: method (field)

  **method**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

    Method by which this process was performed.

  .. _/NXphysical_process/notes-group:

    .. collapse:: This can be any data or other descriptor acquired during the physical process ...

        This can be any data or other descriptor acquired during the physical process
        (NXnote allows to add pictures, audio, movies). Alternatively, a
        reference to the location or a unique identifier or other metadata file. In the
        case these are not available, free-text description.
