**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Base class method-specific for energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS/EDXS). ...

      Base class method-specific for energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS/EDXS).

      `IUPAC instead of Siegbahn notation <https://doi.org/10.1002/xrs.1300200308>`_ should be used.

      X-ray spectroscopy is a surface-sensitive technique. Therefore, three-dimensional elemental
      characterzation requires typically a sequence of characterization and preparation of the
      surface to expose a new surface layer that can be characterized in the next acquisition.
      In effect, the resulting three-dimensional elemental information mappings are truely the
      result of a correlation and post-processing of several measurements which is the field
      of correlative tomographic usage of electron microscopy.

**Symbols**:


  **n_photon_energy**: Number of X-ray photon energy (bins), the fastest direction.

  **n_elements**: Number of identified elements

  **n_peaks**: Number of peaks detected

          Individual element-specific EDS/EDX/EDXS/SXES mapping

          A composition map is an image whose intensities for each pixel are the
          accumulated X-ray quanta *under the curve(s)* of a set of peaks.

          These element-specific EDS maps are NXimage_r_set instances
          and need to be named with the name of the element from the 
          element_names field.

          We often observe that signal contributions from several peaks
          are summarized and shown together, e.g. the combined signal
          under the curve of carbon and oxygen.

          In this case specify the processing details using peaks and weights.
