**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXdata`

      :ref:`NXdata_mpes` describes the plottable data and related dimension scales in photoemission
      experiments.

      It extends the NXdata class and provides a glossary of explicitly named axis names
      which are typical for photoemission data.

  .. index:: energy (field)

  **energy**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_ENERGY <NX_ENERGY>`} :ref:`⤆ </NXdata/AXISNAME-field>`

    .. collapse:: Calibrated energy axis. ...

        Calibrated energy axis.

        In an application definition, this could be a link to either
        /entry/process/energy_calibration/calibrated_axis or
        /entry/process/energy_correction/calibrated_axis.

    .. index:: type (field attribute)

    **@type**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` :ref:`⤆ </NXdata/AXISNAME@long_name-attribute>`

      .. collapse:: The energy can be either stored as kinetic or as binding energy. ...

          The energy can be either stored as kinetic or as binding energy.

          Any of these values:

            * ``kinetic``:  Calibrated kinetic energy axis. This concept is related to term `3.35 <https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:18115:-1:ed-3:v1:en:term:3.35>`_ of the ISO 18115-1:2023 standard.

            * ``binding``:  Calibrated binding energy axis. This concept is related to term `12.16 <https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:18115:-1:ed-3:v1:en:term:12.16>`_ of the ISO 18115-1:2023 standard.


  .. _/NXdata_mpes/kN-field:

  .. index:: kN (field)

  **kN**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_WAVENUMBER <NX_WAVENUMBER>`} :ref:`⤆ </NXdata/AXISNAME-field>`

        One calibrated k-space coordinate. It is envisioned that the axes are named kx, ky, and kz,
        in accordance with the calibrations defined in NXprocess_mpes.

        Typically, the vectors in momentum space are defined such that kx and ky comprise the parallel component,
        while kz is taken as the perpendicular component.

        It is also possible to define k_parallel and k_perp for the parallel and perpendicular momenta, respectively.
        Units are 1/Angström.

  .. _/NXdata_mpes/angularN-field:

  .. index:: angularN (field)

  **angularN**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_ANGLE <NX_ANGLE>`} :ref:`⤆ </NXdata/AXISNAME-field>`

        One calibrated angular coordinate. It is envisioned that the axes are name angular0, angular1, etc.,
        in accordance with the calibrations defined in NXprocess_mpes.

        The angular axes should be named in order of decreasing speed, i.e., angular0 should be
        the fastest scan axis and angular1 should be the slow-axis angular coordinate. However,
        angular0 may also be second slow axis if the measurement is angularly integrated and angular1
        could also be the second fast axis in the case of simultaneous dispersion in two angular
        dimensions.

  .. _/NXdata_mpes/spatialN-field:

  .. index:: spatialN (field)

  **spatialN**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_ANGLE <NX_ANGLE>`} :ref:`⤆ </NXdata/AXISNAME-field>`

        One calibrated spatial coordinate. It is envisioned that the axes are name spatial0, spatial1, etc.,
        in accordance with the calibrations defined in NXprocess_mpes.

        The spatial axes should be named in order of decreasing speed, i.e., spatial0 should be
        the fastest scan axis and spatial1 should be the slow-axis spatial coordinate. However,
        spatial0 may also be second slow axis if the measurement is spatially integrated and spatial1
        could also be the second fast axis in the case of simultaneous dispersion in two spatial
        dimensions.

  .. _/NXdata_mpes/delay-field:

  .. index:: delay (field)

  **delay**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_TIME <NX_TIME>`} :ref:`⤆ </NXdata/DATA-field>`

    Calibrated delay time.

  .. _/NXdata_mpes/polarization_angle-field:

  .. index:: polarization_angle (field)

  **polarization_angle**: (optional) :ref:`NX_FLOAT <NX_FLOAT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_ANGLE <NX_ANGLE>`} 

    .. collapse:: Linear polarization angle of the incoming or outgoing beam. ...

        Linear polarization angle of the incoming or outgoing beam.

        In an application definition, this could be a link to
        /entry/instrument/beam/incident_polarization_angle or
        /entry/instrument/beam/final_polarization_angle if they exist.

  .. _/NXdata_mpes/ellipticity-field:

  .. index:: ellipticity (field)

  **ellipticity**: (optional) :ref:`NX_FLOAT <NX_FLOAT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_ANGLE <NX_ANGLE>`} 

    .. collapse:: Ellipticity of the incoming or outgoing beam. ...

        Ellipticity of the incoming or outgoing beam.

        Can be any of linear polarization angle (degrees), ellipticity (arb. units).
        In an application definition, this could be a link to
        /entry/instrument/beam/incident_ellipticity or
        /entry/instrument/beam/final_ellipticity if they exist.
