**Status**:

  application definition, extends :ref:`NXoptical_spectroscopy`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: An application definition for Raman spectrocopy experiments. ...

      An application definition for Raman spectrocopy experiments.

      Such experiments may be as simple a single Raman spectrum from spontanous
      Raman scattering and range to Raman imaging Raman spectrometer,
      surface- and tip-enhanced Raman techniques, x-Ray Raman scattering, as well
      as resonant Raman scattering phenomena or multidimenional Raman spectra (i.e.
      varying temperature, pressure, electric field, ....)

      The application definition contains two things:
      1. The structures in the application definition of NXopt:
      * Instrument and data calibrations
      * Sensors for sample or beam conditions

      AND

      2. The strucutres specified and extended in NXraman:
      * description of the experiment type
      * descroption of the setup's meta data and optical elements (source, monochromator, detector, waveplate, lens, etc.)
      * description of beam properties and their relations to the sample
      * sample information

      Information on Raman spectroscopy are provided in:

**Symbols**:

  Variables used throughout the document, e.g. dimensions or parameters.

  **N_spectrum**: Length of the spectrum array (e.g. wavelength or energy) of the measured data.

  **N_measurements**: Number of measurements (1st dimension of measured_data array). This is equal to the number of parameters scanned. For example, if the experiment was performed at three different temperatures and two different pressures N_measurements = 2*3 = 6.

  **N_detection_angles**: Number of detection angles of the beam reflected or scattered off the sample.

  **N_incident_angles**: Number of angles of incidence of the incident beam.

  **N_scattering_configurations**: Number of scattering configurations used in the measurement. It is 1 for only parallel polarization meausement, 2 for parallel and cross  polarization measurement or larger, if i.e. the incident and scattered photon direction is varied.
