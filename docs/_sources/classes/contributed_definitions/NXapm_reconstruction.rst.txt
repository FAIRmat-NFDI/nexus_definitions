**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXprocess`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Base class for the configuration and results of a (static) reconstruction algori ...

      Base class for the configuration and results of a (static) reconstruction algorithm.

      Generating a tomographic reconstruction of the specimen uses selected and
      calibrated ion hit positions, the evaporation sequence, and voltage curve data.
      Very often scientists use own software scripts according to published procedures,
      so-called reconstruction protocols.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **n**: Number of ions spatially filtered from results of the hit_finding algorithm :ref:`NXapm_hit_finding` from which an instance of a reconstructed volume has been generated. These ions get new identifier assigned in the process - the so-called evaporation_identifier, which must not be confused with the pulse_identifier!

        Different reconstruction protocols exist. Although these approaches
        are qualitatively similar, each protocol uses different parameters
        (and interprets these differently). The source code to IVAS/APSuite
        is not open. For now users should store reconstruction parameter
        in this free-text field to guide how to parameterize this better in the
        future. For LEAP systems and reconstructions performed with IVAS/APSuite
        see `T. Blum et al. <https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119227250.ch18>`_ (page 371).

        Qualitative statement about which reconstruction protocol was used.

        Different strategies for crystallographic calibration of the
        reconstruction are possible. Therefore, we collect first such
        feedback before parameterizing this further.

        If no crystallographic calibration was performed, the field
        should be filled with the n/a, meaning not applied.

        The nominal diameter of the specimen ROI which is measured in the
        experiment. The physical specimen cannot be measured completely
        because ions may launch but hit in locations other than the detector.

  **reconstructed_positions**: (optional) :ref:`NX_FLOAT <NX_FLOAT>` (Rank: 2, Dimensions: [n, 3]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_LENGTH <NX_LENGTH>`} 

    Three-dimensional reconstructed positions of the ions.

          To get a first visual overview of the reconstructed dataset,
          here a 3d histogram of the ion is stored. Ion counts are characterized
          using one nanometer cubic bins without applying position smoothening
          algorithms during the histogram computation.
