        When selected, the Bias voltage returns to the initial value (before starting the sweep) at 
        the end of the spectroscopy measurement (default). When not selected, Bias remains at the 
        last value of the sweep. This is useful e.g. when combining several sweep segments. Example
        for an automated measurement (using Programming Interface): switch off Z-Controller, start 
        spectroscopy sweep segments (only fwd sweep, no reset bias), set bias back to initial value,
        switch on Z-Controller.

        sweep (the latter only if Record final Z position is selected in the Advanced
        section). After the initial Z averaging time, if Z-Controller to Hold is
        selected in the Advanced section, the Z-Controller is set to hold and the tip is
        placed at the previously averaged Z position (plus Z offset).

    .. collapse:: Time during which the Z-Controller is enabled once a sweep has finished. When ...

        Time during which the Z-Controller is enabled once a sweep has finished. When
        averaging multiple sweeps (i.e. Sweeps>1), the Z-Controller is enabled for this
        duration between each sweep. After the last sweep, it will wait the specified
        time before continuing a running scan. This ensures each sweep reliably starts
        from the same position. This parameter is disabled when Z-Controller to Hold is
        deselected in the Advanced section.

        Select whether to set the Z-Controller on hold (i.e. disabled) during the sweep.
        It is selected by default. When deselected, Z-offset and Z-control time
        parameters are disabled.

  .. _/NXiv_bias/BIAS_SPECTROSCOPY-group:
