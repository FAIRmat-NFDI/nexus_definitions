**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Metadata to a set of pieces of information of a resource that has been serialize ...

      Metadata to a set of pieces of information of a resource that has been serialized.

      A typical use case is the documentation of the source (file) or database (entry)
      from which pieces of information have been extracted for consumption in e.g. a
      research data management system (RDMS). This may be for reasons of enabling
      services such as providing access to normalized information for which reading
      again from the resource may not be desired, possibe, or feasible.

      Possible reasons could be the extraction of specific information for caching,
      performance reasons, or re-evaluate given pieces of information based on other
      views and interaction patterns with the data where information has been formatted
      differently by tools than how these pieces of information were originally
      serialized.

**Structure**:

  .. _/NXserialized/type-field:

  .. index:: type (field)

  **type**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

    .. collapse:: Answers into what resource the information was serialized. ...

        Answers into what resource the information was serialized.

        Any of these values: ``file`` | ``database``

  .. _/NXserialized/path-field:

  .. index:: path (field)

  **path**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

    .. collapse:: Path to the resource. ...

        Path to the resource.

        E.g. the name of a file or its absolute or relative path, or the
        identifier to a resource in another database.

  .. _/NXserialized/checksum-field:

  .. index:: checksum (field)

  **checksum**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

    .. collapse:: Value of the hash that is obtained when running algorithm ...

        Value of the hash that is obtained when running algorithm
        on the content of the resource referred to by path.

  .. _/NXserialized/algorithm-field:

  .. index:: algorithm (field)

  **algorithm**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

    Name of the algorithm whereby the checksum was computed.

  .. _/NXserialized/file-group:

  **file**: (optional) :ref:`NXnote` 

    Extracted file containing the serialized information.
