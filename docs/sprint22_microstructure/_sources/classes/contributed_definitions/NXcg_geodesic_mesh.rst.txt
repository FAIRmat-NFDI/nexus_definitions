      Computational geometry description of a geodesic mesh.

      A geodesic surface mesh is a triangulated surface mesh with metadata which
      can be used as an approximation to describe the surface of a sphere.
      Triangulation of spheres are commonly used in Materials Science
      for quantifying texture of materials, i.e. the relative rotation of
      crystals to sample directions.

      For additional details or an introduction into the topic of geodesic meshes
      see (from which specifically the section on subdivision schemes is relevant).

      Earth scientists have specific demands and different views about what should
      be included in such a base class, given that nested geodesic meshes are a key
      component of climate modelling software. For now we propose to use this
      base class as a container for organizing data related to geodesic meshes.

      Specifically an instance of this base class should detail the rule set how
      e.g. a geodesic (surface) mesh was instantiated as there are many
      possibilities to do so.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
