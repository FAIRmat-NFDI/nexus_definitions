**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Base class for reporting a set of images. ...

      Base class for reporting a set of images.

      This class provides a base vocabulary to be used for specialized :ref:`NXimage_set`
      base classes like :ref:`NXimage_r_set` and :ref:`NXimage_c_set`.

**Symbols**:


  **n_images**: Number of images in the stack.

  **n_y**: Number of pixel per image in the slow direction.

  **n_x**: Number of pixel per image in the fast direction.

**Groups cited**:
  :ref:`NXprocess`, :ref:`NXprogram`, :ref:`NXserialized`
