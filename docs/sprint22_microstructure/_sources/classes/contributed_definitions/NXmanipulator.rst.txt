        Collection of axis-based translations and rotations to describe the location and

        the NXtransformations base class are used. In principle, the McStas coordinate
        system is used. The first transformation has to point either to another
        component of the system or . (for pointing to the reference frame) to relate it
        relative to the experimental setup. Typically, the components of a system should
        all be related relative to each other and only one component should relate to
        the reference coordinate system.
