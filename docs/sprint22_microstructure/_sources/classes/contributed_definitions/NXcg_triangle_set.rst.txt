**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXcg_primitive_set`

**Description**:

  Computational geometry description of a set of triangles.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **d**: The dimensionality, which has to be at least 2.

  **c**: The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of triangles.

  **n_unique**: The number of unique vertices supporting the triangles.

**Groups cited**:

**Structure**:

  .. _/NXcg_triangle_set/number_of_unique_vertices-field:

  .. index:: number_of_unique_vertices (field)

  **number_of_unique_vertices**: (optional) :ref:`NX_INT <NX_INT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`} 

    Number of unique vertices in the triangle set.

  .. _/NXcg_triangle_set/edge_length-field:

  .. index:: edge_length (field)

  **edge_length**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` (Rank: 2, Dimensions: [c, 3]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_LENGTH <NX_LENGTH>`} 

    .. collapse:: Length of the edges of each triangle. ...

        Length of the edges of each triangle.

        For each triangle values are reported via traversing
        the vertices in the sequence as these are defined.

  .. _/NXcg_triangle_set/interior_angle-field:

  .. index:: interior_angle (field)

  **interior_angle**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` (Rank: 2, Dimensions: [c, 3]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_ANGLE <NX_ANGLE>`} 

    .. collapse:: Interior angles of each triangle. ...

        Interior angles of each triangle.

        For each triangle values are reported for the angle opposite
        to the respective edges in the sequence how vertices are defined.

  .. _/NXcg_triangle_set/triangles-group:

  **triangles**: (optional) :ref:`NXcg_face_list_data_structure` 

    .. collapse:: Combined storage of all primitives of all triangles. ...

        Combined storage of all primitives of all triangles.

        This description resembles the typical representation of primitives
        in file formats such as OFF, PLY, VTK, or STL.

  .. _/NXcg_triangle_set/triangleID-group:

  **triangleID**: (optional) :ref:`NXcg_face_list_data_structure` 

    .. collapse:: Individual storage of each triangle. ...

        Individual storage of each triangle.
        Users are advised that using such individual storage of primitives
        may be less storage efficient than creating a combined storage.
