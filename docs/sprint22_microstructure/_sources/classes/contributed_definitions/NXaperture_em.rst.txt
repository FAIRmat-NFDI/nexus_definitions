        Relevant value from the control software.

        This is not always just the diameter of the aperture (not even in the case)
        of a circular aperture. Usually, it is a value that is set in the control
        software whereby a specific configuration of an aperture is selected by the
        software.

        The control software of commercial microscope typically offers the user
        access at a high abstraction level because of which many details about
        the actual settings of the electrical components are typically unknown.

        However, if more details are known or should be documented one should
        use the description field for this.

        Ideally, a (globally) unique persistent identifier, link, or text to a
        resource which gives further details. Alternatively a free-text field to
        store details noteworthy for contextualization or more detail.
