**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXcg_primitive_set`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Computational geometry description of a set of polylines. ...

      Computational geometry description of a set of polylines.

      Each polyline is built from a sequence of vertices (points with identifiers).
      Each polyline must have a start and an end point.
      The sequence describes the positive traversal along the polyline when
      walking from the first to the last vertex.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **d**: The dimensionality, which has to be at least 1.

  **c**: The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of polylines.

  **n_v**: The number of vertices, supporting the polylines.

  **n_total**: The total number of vertices traversed when visiting every polyline.

**Groups cited**:
  none

        The total number of vertices of each polyline, irrespectively
        whether vertices are shared by vertices or not.
        See the docstring for polylines for further details about how
        a set with different polyline members should be stored.

    .. collapse:: Positions of the vertices which support the members of the polyline set. ...

        Positions of the vertices which support the members of the polyline set.

        Users are encouraged to reduce the vertices to unique positions and vertices
        as this often supports with storing geometry data more efficiently.
        It is also possible though to store the vertex positions naively
        in which case vertices_are_unique is likely False.
        Naively, here means that one stores each vertex of a triangle mesh
        even though many vertices are shared between triangles and thus
        storing multiple copies of their positions is redundant.

        If true indicates that the vertices are all placed at different
        positions and have different identifiers, i.e. no points overlap
        or are counted several times.

  .. _/NXcg_polyline_set/polylines-field:

  .. index:: polylines (field)

  **polylines**: (optional) :ref:`NX_INT <NX_INT>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [n_total]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`} 

    .. collapse:: Sequence of identifier for vertices how they build each polyline. ...

        Sequence of identifier for vertices how they build each polyline.

        A trivial example is a set with two polylines with three vertices each.
        If the polylines meet in a junction, say the second vertex is shared
        and marking the junction between the two polylines, it is possible that
        there are only five unique positions. This suggests to store five
        unique vertices.

        A non-trivial example is a set with several polylines. Assume that each
        has a different number of vertices. The array stores the identifier of
        the vertices in the sequence how the polylines are visited:

        The first entry is the identifier of the first vertex of the first polyline,
        followed by the second vertex of the first polyline, until the last vertex
        of the first polyline.
        Thereafter, the first vertex of the second polyline, and so on and so forth.
        Using the (cumulated) counts in number_of_vertices, the vertices of the
        n-th polyline can be accessed on the following array index interval:
        :math:`[\sum_{i=0}^{i=N-1}, \sum_{i=0}^{i=N}]`.
