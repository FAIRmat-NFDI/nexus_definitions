**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Base class for components used in an electron microscope. ...

      Base class for components used in an electron microscope.

      The electron microscope can be a real one or a simulated microscope.
      The key motivation behind this generalization is the observation that in all
      cases a controlled electron beam is generated in reality or that beam is simulated
      and this beam is then used or modified in a controlled manner for the purpose
      of studying physical interaction mechanisms of the beam with matter.
      Here it does not matter whether one considers a real specimen or a simulated one.

      Using a common description for the real experiment in the lab and - what is
      typically a simplification of it - via a computer simulation, has the benefit
      that many pieces of information can be stored in the same way. In effect,
      users are guided with finding information and unnecessary descriptive
      variety for what are exactly the same concept is avoided to work towards
      more interoperability.

      Another motivation to make no fundamental distinction between a scanning and
      a transmission electron microscope is that both are electron microscopes whose
      components are often very similar.
