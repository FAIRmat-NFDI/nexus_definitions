    .. index:: transitions (field)

    **transitions**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

      .. collapse:: Array of strings representing the electronic core levels and Auger transitio ...

          Array of strings representing the electronic core levels and Auger transitions probed in this
          MPES experiment.

          In order for experiments to be comparable, the notation must follow a strict convention.

          **For core levels:**

          - The element symbol (chemical symbol) is written first.
          - It is followed by a whitespace and then the electronic level (e.g., "1s", "2p", "3d", etc.)
          - Fine-structure splitting levels must include the total angular momentum quantum number **J**,
            written as a fraction after the orbital label (e.g., "3d5/2", "4f7/2").
          - When relevant, fine-structure levels should be specified. If multiple fine-structure levels are
            probed, they should either be given explicitly or the generic level (e.g., "3d", "4f") can be used.

          Examples of correct core level notation:

          - "C 1s"
          - "O 1s"
          - "Fe 2p"
          - "Fe 2p3/2"
          - "Fe 2p1/2"
          - "Au 4f"
          - "Au 4f5/2"
          - "Au 4f7/2"

          **For Auger transitions:**

          - The element symbol (chemical symbol) is written first.
          - It is followed by a whitespace and the Auger transitions, which can include:

            - Explicit transitions (e.g., "KLL", "LMM") without fine-structure splitting
            - Explicit transitions (e.g., "KL1L2", "LM1M2") with fine-structure splitting
            - Simplified valence notation (e.g., "KVV", "KLV").
            - Combinations of the above (e.g. "KL1V").

          Examples of correct Auger transition notation:

          - "C KLL"
          - "O KLL"
          - "O KVV"
          - "O KL1L2"

          **Additional Allowed Entries:**

          Besides specific core levels and Auger transitions, the following broader spectral
          regions can also be listed:

          - "Fermi Edge"
          - "Valence Band"
          - "Survey"

          **Incorrect Notation Examples (Do Not Use):**

          - "C1s" (missing space)
          - "O-1s" (incorrect separator)
          - "Fe2p" (missing space)
          - "Au4f7/2" (missing space)
          - "O-KVV" (incorrect separator)
          - "Fe 2p_3/2" (incorrect underscore)
          - "Fe 2p 3/2" (extra space between "p" and "3/2")

                  describe how the electron's wave vector ``k`` is split into components relative
                  to the surface.

                  ``k_parallel`` is the component of the electron's wave vector that is parallel to
                  the surface. It is conserved during the photoemission process. This means that the
                  electron's momentum along the surface inside the material is directly related to
                  its measured momentum outside the material.

                  ``k_perpendicular`` is the component that is normal (perpendicular) to the surface.
                  It is not conserved during photoemission because the electron experiences a potential
                  change when it exits the  material into vacuum. To determine ``k_perpendicular``
                  inside the material, one typically needs to estimate the inner potential :math:`\phi_0`,
                  which accounts for the energy shift due to the material's work function and electronic
                  structure.

            ``k_parallel`` is the component of the electron's wave vector that is parallel to
            the surface. It is conserved during the photoemission process. This means that the
            electron's momentum along the surface inside the material is directly related to

            ``k_perpendicular`` is the component that is normal (perpendicular) to the surface.
            It is not conserved during photoemission because the electron experiences a potential
            change when it exits the  material into vacuum. To determine ``k_perpendicular``
            inside the material, one typically needs to estimate the inner potential :math:`V_0`,
            which accounts for the energy shift due to the material's work function and electronic
            structure.

            coordinate. However, ``angular0`` may also be second slow axis if the measurement

            First calibrated spatial coordinate. It is envisioned that the axes in angular space
            are named ``spatial0`` and ``spatial1``.

            The spatial axes should be named in order of decreasing speed, i.e., ``spatial0``
            should be the fastest scan axis and `spatial1`` should be the slow-axis spatial
            coordinate. However, ``spatial`` may also be second slow axis if the measurement
            is spatially integrated and ``spatial1`` could also be the second fast axis in the
            case of simultaneous dispersion in two spatial dimensions.
