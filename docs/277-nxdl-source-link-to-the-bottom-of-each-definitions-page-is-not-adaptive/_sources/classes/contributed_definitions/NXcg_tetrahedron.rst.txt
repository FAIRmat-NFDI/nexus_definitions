**Status**:

  *base class* (contribution), extends :ref:`NXcg_primitive`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Computational geometry description of a set of tetrahedra. ...

      Computational geometry description of a set of tetrahedra.

      Among hexahedral elements, tetrahedral elements are one of the most
      frequently used geometric primitive for meshing and describing volumetric
      objects in continuum-field simulations.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **c**: The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of tetrahedra.

**Structure**:

  .. _/NXcg_tetrahedron/face_area-field:

  .. index:: face_area (field)

  **face_area**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` (Rank: 2, Dimensions: [c, 4]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_AREA <NX_AREA>`} 

    Area of each of the four triangular faces of each tetrahedron.

  .. _/NXcg_tetrahedron/edge_length-field:

  .. index:: edge_length (field)

  **edge_length**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` (Rank: 2, Dimensions: [c, 6]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_LENGTH <NX_LENGTH>`} 

    Length of each edge of each tetrahedron.

  .. _/NXcg_tetrahedron/tetrahedra-group:

  **tetrahedra**: (optional) :ref:`NXcg_face_list_data_structure` 

    Combined storage of all primitives of all tetrahedra.

  .. _/NXcg_tetrahedron/TETRAHEDRON-group:

  :bolditalic:`TETRAHEDRON`: (optional) :ref:`NXcg_face_list_data_structure` 

    .. collapse:: Individual storage of each tetrahedron. ...

        Individual storage of each tetrahedron.

        Instances should use tetrahedron as a name prefix.

  .. _/NXcg_tetrahedron/TETRAHEDRON_HALF_EDGE-group:

  :bolditalic:`TETRAHEDRON_HALF_EDGE`: (optional) :ref:`NXcg_half_edge_data_structure` 

    .. collapse:: Individual storage of each tetrahedron as a graph. ...

        Individual storage of each tetrahedron as a graph.

        Instances should use tetrahedron_half_edge as a name prefix.
