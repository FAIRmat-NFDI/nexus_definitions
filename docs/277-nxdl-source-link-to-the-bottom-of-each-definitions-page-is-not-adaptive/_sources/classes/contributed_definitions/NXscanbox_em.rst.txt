**Status**:

  *base class* (contribution), extends :ref:`NXcomponent`

**Description**:

      Scan box and coils which deflect a beam of charged particles in a controlled manner.

      The scan box is instructed by (an) instance(s) of :ref:`NXprogram`, some control software,
      which is not necessarily the same program as for all components of an instrument.

      The scanbox directs the probe of charged particles (electrons, ions)
      to controlled locations according to a scan scheme and plan.

        Name of the typically tech-partner-specific term that specifies an
        automated protocol which controls the details how the components
        of the scan_box and instrument work together to achieve a controlled
        scanning of the beam over the sample surface.

        In most cases users do not know, have to care, or are able to disentangle the
        details of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the components of the instrument.
        Instead, they often rely on the assumption that the microscope and control software
        work as expected. The field scan_schema can be used to add some constraints
        on how the beam was scanned over the surface.

        Time period during which the beam remains at one position.

        This concept is related to term `Dwell Time`_ of the EMglossary standard.

        Time period during which the beam moves from the final position of one scan
        line to the starting position of the subsequent scan line.

        This concept is related to term `Flyback Time`_ of the EMglossary standard.

        Details about components which realize the deflection technically.

        This concept should be used for all those components that implement
        the scanning of the beam, while components like beam blankers etc. should
        use rather the NXdeflector concept of the NXebeam_column base class.
