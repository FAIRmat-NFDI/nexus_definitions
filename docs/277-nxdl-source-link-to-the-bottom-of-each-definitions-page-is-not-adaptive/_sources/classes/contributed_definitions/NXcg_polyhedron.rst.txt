**Status**:

  *base class* (contribution), extends :ref:`NXcg_primitive`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Computational geometry description of a set of polyhedra in Euclidean space. ...

      Computational geometry description of a set of polyhedra in Euclidean space.

      Polyhedra or so-called cells (especially in the convex of tessellations) are
      constructed from polygon meshes. Polyhedra may make contact to allow a usage
      of this base class for a description of tessellations.

      For the description of more complicated manifolds and especially for polyhedra
      with holes, users are advised to check if their particular needs are described
      by creating customized instances of an :ref:`NXcg_polygon`.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **c**: The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of polyhedra.

  **n_e_total**: The total number of edges for all polyhedra.

  **n_f_total**: The total number of faces for all polyhedra.

**Groups cited**:
  :ref:`NXcg_face_list_data_structure`, :ref:`NXcg_half_edge_data_structure`

  **number_of_faces**: (optional) :ref:`NX_INT <NX_INT>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [c]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`} 

    .. collapse:: The number of faces for each polyhedron. Faces of adjoining polyhedra ...

        The number of faces for each polyhedron. Faces of adjoining polyhedra
        are counted for each polyhedron.

  .. _/NXcg_polyhedron/face_area-field:

  .. index:: face_area (field)

  **face_area**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [n_f_total]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_AREA <NX_AREA>`} 

    Area of each of faces.

  .. _/NXcg_polyhedron/number_of_edges-field:

  .. index:: number_of_edges (field)

  **number_of_edges**: (optional) :ref:`NX_INT <NX_INT>` 

    .. collapse:: The number of edges for each polyhedron. Edges of adjoining polyhedra ...

        The number of edges for each polyhedron. Edges of adjoining polyhedra
        are counted for each polyhedron.

  .. _/NXcg_polyhedron/edge_length-field:

  .. index:: edge_length (field)

  **edge_length**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [n_e_total]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_LENGTH <NX_LENGTH>`} 

    Length of each edge.

  .. _/NXcg_polyhedron/polyhedra-group:

  **polyhedra**: (optional) :ref:`NXcg_face_list_data_structure` 

    Combined storage of all primitives of all polyhedra.

  .. _/NXcg_polyhedron/POLYHEDRON-group:

  :bolditalic:`POLYHEDRON`: (optional) :ref:`NXcg_face_list_data_structure` 

    .. collapse:: Individual storage of each polyhedron. ...

        Individual storage of each polyhedron.

        Instances should use polyhedron as a name prefix.

  .. _/NXcg_polyhedron/POLYHEDRON_HALF_EDGE-group:

  :bolditalic:`POLYHEDRON_HALF_EDGE`: (optional) :ref:`NXcg_half_edge_data_structure` 

    .. collapse:: Individual storage of each polygon as a graph. ...

        Individual storage of each polygon as a graph.

        Instances should use cluster_analysis as a name prefix.
