**Status**:

  *application definition* (contribution), extends :ref:`NXsensor_scan`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Application definition for temperature-dependent IV curve measurements. ...

      Application definition for temperature-dependent IV curve measurements.

      In this application definition, times should be specified always together
      with an UTC offset.

      This is the application definition describing temperature dependent IV curve
      measurements. For this a temperature is set. After reaching the temperature,
      a voltage sweep is performed. For each voltage a current is measured.
      Then, the next desired temperature is set and an IV measurement is performed.

**Symbols**:


  **n_different_temperatures**: Number of different temperature setpoints used in the experiment.

  **n_different_voltages**: Number of different voltage setpoints used in the experiment.

            List of comma-separated elements from the periodic table
            that are contained in the sample. 
            If the sample substance has multiple components, all 
            elements from each component must be included in `atom_types`.

            The purpose of the field is to offer materials database systems an
            opportunity to parse the relevant elements without having to interpret
            these from the sample history or from other data sources.

            Describes an environment setup for a temperature-dependent IV measurement experiment.

            The temperature and voltage must be present as independently scanned controllers and
            the current sensor must also be present with its readings.

          This NXdata should contain separate fields for the current values at different temperature setpoints, for example current_at_100C.
          There should also be two more fields called temperature and voltage containing the setpoint values.
          There should also be a field with an array of rank equal to the number of different temperature setpoints and each child's dimension
          equal to the number of voltage setpoints.
