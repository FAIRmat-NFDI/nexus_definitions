**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  Base class for components of an instrument - real ones or simulated ones.

**Symbols**:

  No symbol table

**Groups cited**:
  :ref:`NXfabrication`, :ref:`NXprogram`, :ref:`NXtransformations`

**Structure**:

  .. _/NXcomponent/applied-field:

  .. index:: applied (field)

  **applied**: (optional) :ref:`NX_BOOLEAN <NX_BOOLEAN>` 

    Was the component used?

  .. _/NXcomponent/name-field:

  .. index:: name (field)

  **name**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

    Name of the component.

        Ideally, use instances of ``identifierNAME`` to point to a resource
        that provides further details.

        If such a resource does not exist or should not be used, use this free text,
        although it is not recommended.

  .. _/NXcomponent/inputs-field:

  .. index:: inputs (field)

  **inputs**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

    .. collapse:: Instance or list of instances of ``NXcomponent`` (or base classes ...

        Instance or list of instances of ``NXcomponent`` (or base classes
        extending ``NXcomponent``) or ``NXbeam`` that act as input(s) to this 
        component.

        Each input should point to the path of the group acting as input.

        An example usage would be to chain components and/or beams together to describe
        the beam path in an experiment.

  .. _/NXcomponent/outputs-field:

  .. index:: outputs (field)

  **outputs**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

    .. collapse:: Instance or list of instances of ``NXcomponent`` (or base classes ...

        Instance or list of instances of ``NXcomponent`` (or base classes
        extending ``NXcomponent``) or ``NXbeam`` that act as output(s) of this
        component.

        For more information, see :ref:`inputs </NXcomponent/inputs-field>`.

  .. _/NXcomponent/depends_on-field:

  .. index:: depends_on (field)

        Specifies the position of the component by pointing to the last
        transformation in the transformation chain that is defined
        via the NXtransformations group.

        NeXus positions components by applying a set of translations and rotations
        to apply to the component starting from 0, 0, 0. The order of these operations
        is critical and forms what NeXus calls a dependency chain. The depends_on
        field defines the path to the top most operation of the dependency chain or the
        string "." if located in the origin. Usually these operations are stored in a
        NXtransformations group. But NeXus allows them to be stored anywhere.

        Collection of axis-based translations and rotations to describe the
        location and geometry of the component in the instrument. The dependency
        chain may however traverse similar groups in other component groups.
