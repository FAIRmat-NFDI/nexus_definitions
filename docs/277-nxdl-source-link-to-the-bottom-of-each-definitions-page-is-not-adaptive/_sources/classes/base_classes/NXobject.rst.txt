      If nameType="partial", the placeholders (e.g., FIELDNAME or GROUPNAME)
      can be replaced by the name of any object (field or group, 
      respectively) that exists within the same group.

        Declares which child group contains a path leading
        to a :ref:`NXdata` group or a group using a base class
        extending :ref:`NXdata`.

        It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
        to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.

    .. collapse:: An identifier for a (persistent) resource. ...

        An identifier for a (persistent) resource.

        An identifier, provided by some authority, that has been assigned to an
        object described by this ``NXobject``. To be useful, the identifier
        must not be reassigned to a different real-world object. It is typical for
        there to be some mechanism to resolve an identifier, obtaining metadata
        about the object. Identifiers for which some guarantees exist regarding
        this resolution process are called persistent identifiers.
        Persistent identifiers are also known as PIDs.

    .. _/NXobject/identifierNAME@type-attribute:

    .. index:: type (field attribute)

    **@type**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

      .. collapse:: The type of identifier used. ...

          The type of identifier used.

          It is recommended to use the most specific type when describing the identifier.

          For example, all IGSNs (see below) are DOIs and all DOIs are Handles; however, an IGSN should have type IGSN (and not DOI or Hdl).
          Similarly, an ARK, Purl, ORCID and ROR identifiers should have their corresponding types and should not use the more generic URL identifier.

          Any of these values or a custom value (if you use a custom value, also set @custom=True):

            * ``ARK``:  Archival Resource Key. An ARK is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) designed to support long-term access to a variety of information objects. Syntax: https://NMA/ark:/NAAN/Name[Qualifier]. Brackets indicate optional elements. Example: https://example.org/ark:/12345/abcde

            * ``DOI``:  Digital Object Identifier. A DOI is a unique alphanumeric string used to identify digital content. It consists of a prefix and a suffix, separated by a slash. Syntax: 10.XXXX/XXXXXX Example: 10.1107/S1600576714027575

            * ``Hdl``:  A handle is a unique identifier that consists of a prefix indicating the naming authority and a suffix representing the local name of a resource. A handle is a unique identifier used to facilitate the identification and management of digital objects. It is composed of a prefix that indicates the naming authority and a suffix that specifies the resource's local name. This refers specifically to an ID in the Handle system operated by the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI). Syntax: prefix/identifier Example: 123456789/abc123

            * ``IGSN``:  International Generic Sample Number. The IGSN is a unique identifier assigned to a specific sample or specimen in the context of scientific research. Since 2021, IGSNs are issued by DataCite, meaning that there are now DataCite-issued DOIs for all IGSNs, including those historical IGSNs issued beforehand. Therefore, the syntax is the same as for DOIs. Syntax: 10.XXXX/XXXXXX Example: 10.1107/S1600576714027575

            * ``ISNI``:  ISNI is an ISO standard to uniquely identify individuals and organizations involved in creative work, including pseudonyms and other public personas. An ISNI-ID is made up of 16 digits, the last character being a check character. The check character may be either a decimal digit or the character “X”. A URL can be generated from the ISNI ID by combining it with the prefix https://isni.org/isni/, resulting in https://isni.org/isni/{ISNI-ID}. Syntax: 16 base-10 digits stored without any spaces. Example: 0000000121032683

            * ``ISSN``:  International Standard Serial Number An ISSN is an 8-digit unique identifier used to distinguish a serial publication, whether in print or electronic form. The last character (a digit or 'X') serves as a check character, making the ISSN uniquely defined by its first seven digits. Syntax: NNNN-NNNC, where N a decimal digit character (i.e., in the set {0,1,2,...,9}), and C is in {0,1,2,...,9,X} Example: 1234-5678 or 1234-567X

            * ``ISSN-L``:  Linking ISSN The linking ISSN, or ISSN-L, is a specific ISSN that groups the different media of the same serial publication. Syntax: NNNN-NNNC, where N a decimal digit character (i.e., in the set {0,1,2,...,9}), and C is in {0,1,2,...,9,X} Example: 1234-5678 or 1234-567X

            * ``ORCID``:  Open Researcher and Contributor identifier. ORCID provides a free and persistent identifier that uniquely distinguishes authors and contributors in scientific research. Syntax: https://orcid.org/XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX Example: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097

            * ``PURL``:  Persistent Uniform Resource Locator. A Persistent Uniform Resource Locator (PURL) is a type of URL designed to provide a stable, long-term reference to a web resource by using a resolver to redirect users to the resource's current location, even if it moves over time. A PURL has three parts: (1) a protocol, (2) a resolver address, and (3) a name. Syntax: https://purl.org/foo/bar Example: https://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title

            * ``ROR``:  Research Organization Registry A ROR ID is a globally unique identifier for research organizations, enabling unambiguous linking of institutions across systems. Syntax: https://ror.org/{ROR-ID} Example: https://ror.org/052gg0110

            * ``URL``:  Uniform Resource Locator Also known as web address, a URL is the address used to access a resource on the internet, specifying its location and the protocol to retrieve it. Syntax: scheme://domain:port/path?query_string#fragment_id Example: https://www.example.com/about

            * ``URN``:  Uniform Resource Name A URN is a unique, persistent identifier for a resource regardless of where it is stored. It is recommended that identifiers with more specific type attribute (such as DOI or ISSN) values should not be stored as a URN, even when this is valid. As an example, the URN doi:10.1107/S1600576714027575 is a valid URN-based representation for the DOI 10.1107/S1600576714027575, but it is recommended to use type="DOI" in this case. Syntax: urn:<namespace>:<namespace-specific-string>. The leading urn: sequence is case-insensitive. Example: urn:isbn:0000000000000
