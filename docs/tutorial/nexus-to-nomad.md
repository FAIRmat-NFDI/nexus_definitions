# Uploading NeXus files to NOMAD

Great choice! [Nomad](https://nomad-lab.eu/nomad-lab/tutorials.html) makes it easier than ever to work with your research data. At this point you are probably have an idea of what FAIR data is, [wilkinson et al](...). Even if you don't, it doesn't matter. Nomad provides a simple graphical interface that let's you collect and have your data ready for publication.

In this tutorial, we will go through how one can upload their NeXus files to Nomad.

Nomad, as a FAIR data platform, supports NeXus and allows users to upload their NeXus (.nxs) files directly. These files get interpreted and added to your Nomad account with complete control on how you would like to present and publish them alongside your research.

## Create an Upload

Nomad allows you to have a draft working space called an **upload**. This allows you to test and prepare how your data will look in Nomad before you publish it.

Go to ```Publish -> Uploads```
