Application Definitions
#######################

:ref:`NXarchive`
    This is a definition for data to be archived by ICAT (https://www.icatproject.org/).

:ref:`NXfluo`
    This is an application definition for raw data from an X-ray fluorescence experiment.

:ref:`NXmx`
    Functional application definition for macromolecular crystallography.

:ref:`NXrefscan`
    This is an application definition for a monochromatic scanning reflectometer.

:ref:`NXreftof`
    This is an application definition for raw data from a TOF reflectometer.

:ref:`NXscan`
    Application definition for a generic scan instrument.

:ref:`NXspe`
    NXSPE Inelastic Format.  Application definition for NXSPE file format.

:ref:`NXsqom`
    This is the application definition for S(Q, OM) processed data.

:ref:`NXstxm`
    Application definition for a STXM instrument.

:ref:`NXtas`
    This is an application definition for a triple axis spectrometer.

:ref:`NXtomo`
    This is the application definition for x-ray or neutron tomography raw data. 

:ref:`NXtomophase`
    This is the application definition for x-ray or neutron tomography raw data
    with phase contrast variation at each point. 

:ref:`NXtomoproc`
    This is an application definition for the final result of a tomography experiment:
    a 3D construction of some volume of physical properties.

:ref:`NXxas`
    This is an application definition for raw data from an X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiment. 

:ref:`NXxasproc`
    Processed data from XAS. This is energy versus I(incoming)/I(absorbed).
