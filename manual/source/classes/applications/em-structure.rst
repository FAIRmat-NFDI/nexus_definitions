Introduction
############

A set of data schemas is available to describe components of an electron microscope (EM) and its potentially available focused-ion beam
functionalities.

Electron microscopes are functionally very customizable tools: Examples include multi-signal/-modal analyses which are frequently realized as
on-the-fly computational analyses, regularly switching between GUI-based instrument control, computational steps, and more and more using
high-throughput stream-based processing. Also artificial intelligence methods are increasingly used and are becoming more closely
interconnected with classical modes of controlling the instrument and perform data processing. A challenge in electron microscopy
is that these steps are often executed within commercial integrated control and analysis software. This makes it difficult to keep
track of workflows in a technology-partner-agnostic, i.e. interdisciplinary manner.

The application definitions and associated base classes were designed from the perspective of how electron microscopes are used in the
materials-science-branch of electron microscopy. Therefore, the focus is on the usage of electron microscopy in condensed-matter physics,
chemical physics of solids, and materials engineering applications.

The biology-/bio-materials/omics-branch of electron microscopy (which also has a mature state of discussion with respect to data
management practices) was not the focus of the original design of the applcation definition. However, as many of the components of electron
microscopes used in the bio-materials communities are the same or at least many components are very similar, it is likely that the application
definition can also inspire discussion and exchange with the bio-materials community.

It is acknowledged that it can be difficult to agree on a single application definition which is generally enough applicable, yet not
unnecessarily complex and useful for applications across a variety of instruments, technology partners, and instrument use cases.

Design
######

NXem provides support for documenting research with scanning electron microscopes (SEM), scanning electron microscopes that are equipped with
focused-ion beam (FIB) capabilities, and transmission respectively scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM and STEM).
The actual design of the electron-optical beam path and individual components used differ often substantially.
Therefore, NXem allows to describe an arbitrary number of components. These modular building blocks are
realized via using instances of base classes which offer concepts that are specific for electron microscopy.

The following three figures provide one schematic example for each respective type of instrument. Specifically, how the concepts of NXem
can be used to describe each instrument. All figures are meant for illustrative and educational purposes. The figures build up complexity
successively starting with the simpler case of a SEM (Fig. 1), moving to a SEM with FIB capabilities (Fig. 2), arriving at
a (S)TEM (Fig. 3). The capabilities that are illustrated for the SEM in Fig. 1 are also offered for all further cases but not
always repeated in Figs. 2 and 3 for the sake of conciseness. The examples take the perspective of typical users who are
interested in reporting the metadata and data that have been collected during a session with the microscope:

**Fig. 1** - an example for a SEM
The instrument is constructed from a so-called column, a housing for all technical components such as the electron source,
the lenses, like here shown a condenser and an objective lens, respective apertures, and further components, like a stigmator
to correct for axial image distortions. The trajectory of the electron beam along the optical axis is simplified for
illustrative purposes. In summary, the sample is illuminated by an electron beam that is guided along the optical axis
through and past a set of components. A scan controller is used to deflect this beam to illuminate specific locations
on the sample surface. In response to the electron-beam sample interaction and interaction volume is formed.
Different types of signals are generated that are picked up by different types of detectors. Three detectors
are shown as an example. Apart from the column, a SEM has further components. The base classes that are used for
modeling these are listed in the lower part of the figure. These document pumps and other hardware, assumptions made
such as frames of references and transformations between these frames, and the computing hardware and software tools
that are used for controlling the SEM and all its connected components. Using an electron microscope demands
processing of data. These processing steps are modeled with instances of the NXprocess base class.
Method-specific base classes are provided that inherit from NXprocess. These are used for documenting
the parameterization, the results, and sequence of such steps. Examples of method-specific base classes
are NXem_ebsd for electron backscatter diffraction, NXem_eds for energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, NXem_img
for different imaging modes and NXem_eels for electron energy loss spectroscopy.

**Fig. 2** - an example for a SEM with plasma FIB capabilities
Adding or flanging another column to an electron microscope equips it with focused-ion beam capabilities.
The design of this ibeam_column follows the design of the ebeam_column, a housing with technical components, such as
the ion source, lenses, apertures, beam distortion and beam shaping components, and an own scan controller
for guiding the ion beam towards the sample surface. Like in Fig. 1 the trajectory of the ion beam is simplified.

**Fig. 3** an example for a (S)TEM
The design principles for the SEM as well as the FIB are used for modeling a transmission electron microscope.
Noteworthy is that the figure illustrates an optical setup that is a mixture of a conventional TEM and a STEM.
The presence of a scan_controller is one characteristic feature of an STEM. Given that a TEM specimen is typically
orders of magnitude thinner than a SEM specimen, the electron beam can penetrate the material. This enables
investing additional imaging modes and probing other characteristic electron-matter interactions the most
prominent of which electron energy loss spectroscopy. Consequently, additional lens and components are introduced
into the beam path of the exiting electrons.

Application Definition
######################

An experiment with an electron microscope proceeds as follows: users place a sample into the microscope, calibrate the instrument,
take measurements, may prepare their specimens with a focused ion beam, calibrate again, and take further measurements,
they process data, until eventually their session on the instrument ends. In between, virtually all of these steps data
are collected and stream in from different detectors. Each detector probes different physical mechanisms
of the interaction between electrons or other types of radiation with the specimen. A microscope session ends with the scientist
removing the specimen from the instrument or parking it so that the next user can start a session.
Occasionally, service technicians perform calibrations and maintenance which also can be described as a session on the microscope.
We have provided base classes to describe these steps and events and an application definition for electron microscopy.

A simulation of an electron microscope or of electron beam matter interaction takes a simpler perspective on many of these
practical aspects. Typically an electron-optical setup and material is defined, assumptions about the properties and trajectory
of the electron beam are made or simulated. The simulation analyzes the interaction volume by inspecting e.g. the trajectories of
individual electrons or by modeling their collective behavior via computing numerical solutions or approximations for the
beam electromagnetic field.

There currently exists a single application definition for describing EM experiments:

:ref:`NXem`
    A general application definition which explores the possibilities of electron microscopes
    for characterizing electron- and ion-beam matter interactions.
