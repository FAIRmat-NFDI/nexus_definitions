Introduction
############

These are a set of application definition to describe multidimensional photoemission (MPES) experiments including x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS),
hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES), angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), two-photon photoemission (2PPE) 
and photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM). Also includes descriptors for advanced specializations, such as spin-resolution, time resolution, 
near-ambient pressure conditions, dichroism etc.

Application Definitions
#######################

:ref:`NXmpes`:
   A general application definition with minimalistic metadata requirements, apt to describe all photemission experiments.

:ref:`NXmpes_arpes`:
   An application definition for angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments.

:ref:`NXxps`:
   An application definition for X-ray/UV photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS) experiments.


Base classes
