Noteworthy, NeXus-FAIRmat works with a fork of the official NeXus definitions.
Therefore, expect individual definitions may differ between versions when
comparing the official NeXus repository and the fork maintained by FAIRmat.
FAIRmat and NeXus exchange frequently to sync up such that the FAIRmat fork
builds always on top of the latest official NeXus release.
