Scanning Probe Microscopy
===============================

Scientists of the scanning Probe Microscopy community and FAIRmat have worked 
together to create a bunch of application definitions and related base classes
for documenting diverse experiment techniques (STS - Scanning Tunneling 
Spectroscopy, STM - Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and AFM - Atomic Force 
Microscopy) in SPM domain.

This is one community under the large umbrella of scanning (probe) microscopy 
methods. A status report of these efforts will be reported here: 
:ref:`Spm-Structure`.
