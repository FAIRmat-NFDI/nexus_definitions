Photoemission & core-level spectroscopy
=======================================

The NXmpes application definition aims at describing data and metadata obtained with any possible multidimensional PES setup.
Hence, it is very general and currently the only limitation to the data is that an energy
axis has to be present.
The general experimental techniques described by this application definitions are
photon-in and photoelectron-out.
If you want NXmpes for such a techniques, changes are good you find something useful here.

Example techniques covered by this application definition include x-ray/UV photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS),
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), two-photon photoemission (2PPE) or
photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM).
We also include descriptors for advanced specializations, such as spin- and time-resolution, near-ambient pressure conditions,
dichroism and many more.

       A general appdef with minimalistic metadata requirements to describe all photemission experiments.
