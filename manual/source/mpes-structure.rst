Introduction
############

Set of data storage objects to describe photoemission experiments including x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS),
hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES), angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), two-photon photoemission (2PPE) 
and photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM). We also included descriptors for advanced specializations, such as spin-resolution, time resolution, 
near-ambient pressure conditions, dichroism etc.

Application Definitions
#######################

We created two new application definitions:

    :ref:`NXmpes`:
       A general appdef with minimalistic metadata requirements, apt to describe all photemission experiments.
