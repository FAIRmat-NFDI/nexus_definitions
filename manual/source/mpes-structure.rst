=======================================
Photoemission & core-level spectroscopy
=======================================

The NXmpes application definition aims at describing any possible multidimensional PES setup.
Hence, it is very general and currently the only limitation to the data is that an energy
axis has to be present.
The general experimental techniques described by this application definitions are
photons in and photoelectrons out.
If you want NXmpes for such a techniques, changes are good you find something useful here.

An example set of techniques covered by this application defintions are x-ray/UV photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS),
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), two-photon photoemission (2PPE) or
photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM).
We also include descriptors for advanced specializations, such as spin- and time-resolution, near-ambient pressure conditions,
dichroism and many more.

       A general appdef with minimalistic metadata requirements to describe all photemission experiments.
